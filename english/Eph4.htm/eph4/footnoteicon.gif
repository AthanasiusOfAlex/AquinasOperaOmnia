var WPFootnote2 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p><i>De Natura Boni, </i>Ch. 3 (P.L. 42, 553). Translated by A. Newman in N.P.N.F. Vol. 4, 1887, p. 352. As St. Thomas\
interprets these in <i>S.T.</i> I, 5, 5, measure (&#8220;modus&#8221;) refers to the prerequisites of a being, for instance, sub-atomic\
particles are prerequisites for the chemical elements. Form (&#8220;species&#8221;) is what the being is, its immanent\
intelligibility, cf. note 37 above. Order (&#8220;ordo&#8221;) refers to an inclination in a being to achieve a goal, produce an act,\
or the like, e.g., the unstable chemical elements possess an &#8220;ordo&#8221; toward forming compounds. The balanced\
harmony (&#8220;tranquillitas&#8221;) which results from the proper interplay of these three is by no means equivalent to static\
immobility; it often is very dynamic. These three aspects of a being admit of a wide variety of applications on many\
levels. On the plane of human existence and its relation to God, sin destroys the proper unfolding of man&#8217;s &#8220;ordo&#8221;\
toward God and so disrupts the harmony in the measure, form and order of grace (<i>S.T.</i> I-I, 85, 4). Contrariwise,\
God&#8217;s redeeming love for man and man&#8217;s response in love effects a true harmony or peace (<i>ibid.</i>, II-II, 29, 1-4). St.\
Thomas remarks that this balanced harmony &#8220;is achieved when each possesses what is proper to himself&#8221; because\
diversity is an essential element in the building up of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:1 ff.; and Ch. 4, Lect. 4 below).\
St. Augustine&#8217;s immediate application of measure, form, and order, are to the good, but Aquinas uses them in a\
definition of peace in view of Augustine&#8217;s reflections in <i>The City of God</i>, XIX, 13 (cf. <i>S.T.</i> II-II, 29, 1 ad 1).</p>\

physical, chemical, biological, psychological and intellectual multiplicity. For St. Thomas&#8217; teaching in summary\
form, cf. Longergan, &#8220;Me Concept of <i>Verbum </i>in the Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas,&#8221; <i>T.S.</i> Sept. 1946, pp. 366-68.\

</span>'

var WPFootnote9 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The doctrine of the Hypostatic Union, as formulated in the Councils of Chalcedon (451 A.D.) and II\
Constantinople (553), teaches that the Divine Nature and Human Nature of Christ are united in the unity of the\
Second Person of the Blessed Trinity. &#8220;Nature&#8221; signifies <i>what </i>something is, whereas &#8220;person&#8221; signifies <i>he who </i>has\
such and such a nature. Thus the union of two natures could not occur in one or the other of the natures themselves\
since they are mutually exclusive, humanity is not divinity and vice versa. But the two natures can be united in the\
<i>Person who </i>thereby possesses two natures, cf. <i>S.T.</i> III, 2, 2-3. In the next two sentences some editions of the Parma\
omit the words, &#8220;He who ascends is the Son of Man, raising human nature&#8221; and simply have &#8220;For he who descended,\
as was said, is the Son of God taking on human nature to the preeminence of immortal life.&#8221;</p>\

var WPFootnote10 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#160;Cf. note 33 above. The reference here is to Chapters 5 and 6 of the <i>Ecclesiastica Hierarchia </i>(P.G. 3, 505 ff.). By\
&#8220;state of perfection&#8221; St. Thomas is not referring to the technically theological sense of &#8220;status perfectionis,&#8221; by which\
the Episcopacy and religious institutes are designated. He is rather referring to the more general sense in which all\
Christians who strive to perfect their love of God and men are in a state or condition of perfection, cf. <i>S.T.</i> II-II, 184,\
1-3. The role of religious institutes and the Episcopacy is to give certain types of external expression to this inner\
search for, and attainment of, the perfection of love, <i>ibid., </i>184, 4 ff. For men need to express their love and worship\
externally, <i>ibid., </i>27, 6 ad 3; 30, 4 ad 1; 81, 7; 84, 2.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote11 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#160;The Vulgate text St. Thomas is quoting reads: &#8220;Consummatio abbreviata inundabit justitiam. Consummationem\
enim, et abbreviationem Dominus Deus exercituum faciet.&#8221; In his commentary on Isaias 10:22-23 St. Thomas takes\
the literal meaning of &#8220;consummatio abbreviata&#8221; as referring to the destruction of Jerusalem and Judaea by\
Sennacherib. Modern biblical scholars tend to agree; the new Confraternity Edition translates the difficult Hebrew\
passage: &#8220;Their destruction is decreed, as overwhelming justice demands. Yes, the destruction he has decreed, the\
Lord, the God of hosts, will carry out within the whole land.&#8221; Aquinas also notes there <i>(Comm. In Is. </i>10:22) that in\
Rom. 9:27-29 this same passage is used in reference to those who will be saved, the remnant; it could be in this sense\
that he is quoting it here. Aquinas also notes that in the Septuagint it reads &#8220;an abbreviated word&#8221; (<i>logon suntelon</i>)<i>\
</i>instead of &#8220;a consumption abridged.&#8221; Following Patristic exegesis, be sees this as either a reference to the Gospel\
as a summation of perfection (cf. Mt. 22:40), or to the Word Incarnate who, in himself, sums up all that had been\
revealed through many prophets, cf. H. de Lubac, S.J., <i>Ex&eacute;g&egrave;se m&eacute;di&eacute;vale, </i>(Paris: Aubier, 1961) 2-18, pp. 181-97).\
Thus, here he could be saying that the evangelical character of the Church&#8217;s ministry will share in the Gospel&#8217;s\
perfecting power. Most likely, in quoting this passage of Isaias Aqinas had all of these nuances in mind, for the\
&#8220;perfecting of the saints&#8221; translates &#8220;ad consummationem sanctorum&#8221; so that the occurrence of &#8220;consummatio&#8221; in\
Is. 10:22 suggested itself. On this use of parallel texts and verbal association in Aquinas&#8217; exegesis, cf. Spicq, <i>op. cit.,\
</i>703, 721.</p>\

var WPFootnote12 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The &#8220;speaking with tongues&#8221; St. Paul is here referring to should not be confused with the Pentecostal &#8220;gift of\
tongues&#8221; (Ac. 2:1-13) which possibly meant that the first disciples spoke, or were understood in, other languages,\
cf. <i>S.T.</i> II-II, 176, 1. (This has been called into question by no less an authority than S. Lyonnet, S.J., who holds that\
the Pentecostal &#8220;gift of tongues&#8221; was also a question of prayer and not of preaching, cf. <i>Verbum Domini</i>, Vol. 24<i>\
</i>(1944), pp. 65-7,5). The phenomenon of &#8220;glossolalia&#8221; mentioned here and in 1 Cor. 14 was the utterance of\
unintelligible sounds or incoherent words during an ecstatic state. Hence Paul&#8217;s insistence that this charisma should\
not dominate the liturgical assembly unless someone was present who had the gift of interpreting the sounds so that\
those present could receive some instruction.</p>\

var WPFootnote13 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>In Scripture the eagle is a symbol of the saints or heavenly beings (cf. Ez. 1:10; 10:14; Apoc. 4:7) whose life has\

</span>'

var WPFootnote14 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>&#160;In Gal. 4:1 St. Paul says that all men under the Old Covenant were like a young boy who is an heir (and they were\
heirs to the New Covenant) and yet is under tutors (the Old Law) until Christ comes. Since the &#8220;body of the Church\
is made up of men who existed from the beginning of the world until its end&#8221; (<i>S.T.</i> III, 8, 3c) it also underwent this\
gradual development. And it grows now as new members are, brought into it.</p>\
</span>'

var WPFootnote15 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas is here referring to a supposed incident in the death of Arius as related by St. Athanasius in his <i>De\
Morte Arii, </i>(P.G. 25 col. 688). Like the death of Judas recorded in Acts 1:18, Arius was suddenly stricken down,\
either from a fall or a swelling (the Greek Athanasius uses is exactly that of Acts 1:18), and his abdomen burst\
asunder&#8212;&#8220;crepuit medius.&#8221; Historians see no reason to deny that Arius died suddenly, cf. G. Bardy in <i>Histoire de\
l&#8217;Eglise, </i>t. 3 (Bloud et Gay, 1947) p. 113; but the details are certainly tendentious. Aquinas&#8217; harshness with Arius\
is probably due to the storm of controversy and political intrigue involved in the spread of his heretical teaching. He\
was condemned at Alexandria in 321 and at Nicea in 325 for denying the Divinity of the Word. Without a distinction\
between Nature and Person, he could not grasp how the Son is as fully God is the Father. Hence he held that the\
Word is God&#8217;s first and most perfect creature <i>(ktima, poiema), </i>created from nothing. Nicea countered this with its\
belief that the Word is consubstantial (<i>homoousion</i>) with the Father. Despite the condemnation, Arius&#8217; doctrine and\
influence spread widely due mostly to the active support of the emperors Constantius II and Valens, as well as his\
subtle use of the Greek terminology involved to bypass the orthodox formulations.</p>\

that &#8220;compositionem ab unoquoque membro egredientem, secundum mensurain gratiae sibi datae, et actualem&#8221; were\
to be found in the margins of one of the oldest manuscripts. He put the words in the margin of his own edition but,\
by the time of the Veneta edition of 1593, they were included in the text itself. No trace of the manuscript he referred\
to has been located and the authenticity of the interpolation is questioned, cf. the preface of R. Cai, O.P., in his re-edition of the Piana <i>Super Epistolas S. Pauli Lectura </i>(Rome: Marietti, 1953) pp. x-xiv.</p>\

</span>'

var WPFootnote20 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Vulgate translated the Greek <i>noos </i>of Eph. 4:17 as &#8220;sensus,&#8221; which in the Douay-Rheims is rendered &#8220;mind.&#8221;\
The commentary is not clear as to whether the &#8220;reason&#8221; St. Thomas is here referring to is the practical reason which\
is the <i>subjectum </i>of prudence (cf. <i>S.T.</i> II-II, 47, 1-3) or the &#8220;ratio particularis,&#8221; or internal sense of appraisal, which\
is also called the &#8220;vis cogitativa&#8221; or &#8220;vis apprehensiva&#8221; in its more directly cognitative aspects. That he does mean\
by &#8220;reason&#8221; this &#8220;ratio particularis&#8221; is favored by his later identification of &#8220;sensus&#8221; with &#8220;vis apprehensiva.&#8221; This\
power is generically of the same type as that found in lower animals (<i>S.T.</i> I, 78, 4 ad 5), but in man it is brought to\
greater perfection because of the influence his intellectual reason exerts over its activities (<i>ibid., </i>1, 78, 4c). Whereas\
lower animals must rely on instinct in their appraisal of what is good (liked) or bad (disliked), man&#8217;s &#8220;particular\
reason&#8221;&#8212;which might be rendered as &#8220;the faculty of direct appraisal&#8221;&#8212;is able to be checked by his intellect (<i>ibid.,\
</i>I, 81, 3c), and so enjoy a greater freedom (<i>ibid.</i>,<i> </i>I, 83, 1c). For example, man can freely choose to undergo medicinal\
treatment that is painful. The terms &#8220;reason&#8221; and &#8220;judgment&#8221; in reference to this faculty of direct appraisal must not\
be taken in a strictly intellectual sense. As Aquinas points out here, it can be upright or perverted depending on\
whether or not man&#8217;s intellectual powers guide it according to the proper moral standards. These latter are termed\
&#8220;synderesis&#8221; which is the habit of primary or general moral principles applicable to the sphere of human activity\
(<i>ibid., </i>1, 79, 12) as the immanent standards in men which give their consciences a normative force (<i>ibid., </i>79, 13);\
e.g., the most basic one of doing good and avoiding evil. By &#8220;the divine law or God&#8221; Aquinas is referring to the\
Eternal Law which God himself is (<i>ibid., </i>I-II, 91, 1 ad 3; 93,1-2) and from whom all other norms of action are\
derived (<i>ibid., </i>93, 3). For a further discussion of the &#8220;ratio particularis&#8221; cf. R. E. Brennan, O.P., <i>Thomistic\
Psychology </i>(New York: Macmillan, 1949), pp. 133-35, 144-46, 201-02; compare with the contemporary treatment\
of these psychological phenomena by M. B. Arnold, <i>Emotion and Personality </i>(New York: Columbia Univ. Press,\
1960), Vol. 1, pp. 61-66, 171-77, 189-91, 231-33, and Vol. 2, pp. 193-202.</p>\

these interior psychological functions, even when they are also possessed by animals lower than man, cf. S.C.G. IV,\
2-3. <i>Mind </i>here is definitely a rationally spiritual faculty and not that discussed in<i> </i>lecture 6 above (cf. note 124) since\

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first section is again divided into two parts:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he cautions them to keep ecclesial unity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he sets forth the pattern of this Church unity (4:5 ff.).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first part has three divisions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he offers certain incentives to maintain ecclesial unity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">Secondly, he sets down an admonition (4:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, he shows the purpose of his admonition (4:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Three incentives are given for them to maintain the Church&#8217;s unity. First is the devotedness of
Paul&#8217;s love, second is the remembrance of his chains, and third is the consideration of the divine
favors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The affection of his love is intimated by his entreaty. <span style="font-weight: bold">Therefore</span> because you have obtained so
many blessings from the Lord, <span style="font-weight: bold">I beseech you</span>. I do not command you even though I could; on
account of my lowliness I do not command but plead with you. Proverbs 18 (23) remarks: &#8220;The
poor will speak with supplications.&#8221; Charity is another reason [for such a procedure], it prompts
men to action more than fear: &#8220;Wherefore, though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus to
command thee that which is to the purpose, for charity&#8217;s sake I rather beseech&#8221; (Phm. 1:8). He
stirs them by recalling his chains: <span style="font-weight: bold">I, a prisoner in the Lord. </span>With these words he urges them to
remain united, giving them three motives.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">First, a friend sympathizes with a suffering friend and more readily tries to fulfill his wishes so
that be might thereby console him. &#8220;A friend shall not be known in prosperity, and an enemy
shall not be hidden in adversity. In the prosperity of a man, his enemies are grieved; and a friend
is known in his adversity&#8221; (Ecclus. 12:8-9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, the Apostle himself suffers imprisonment for their own utility. Hence he urges them
to remember this, as though he wanted to put them under certain obligations. &#8220;Now, whether we
be in tribulation, it is for your exhortation and salvation; or whether we be comforted, it is for
your consolation; or whether we be exhorted, it is for your exhortation and salvation, which
worketh the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer&#8221; (2 Cor. 1:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, as was mentioned previously in Chapter Three (v. 13) where he writes &#8220;my tribulations
for you, which is your glory,&#8221; these sufferings were for the Ephesians&#8217; own immense glory. For
God exposed his own chosen friends to adversities in behalf of their salvation. Therefore he adds
<span style="font-weight: bold">in the Lord </span>which means, on account of the Lord. Or, he annexes <span style="font-weight: bold">in the Lord </span>since it was the
Apostle&#8217;s glory to be imprisoned, not as a thief or murderer, but as a Christian and for the sake
of our Lord Jesus Christ, in accordance with Ezechiel 3 (25): &#8220;And thou, O son of man, behold,
they shall put bands upon thee, and they shall bind thee with them: and thou shalt not go forth
from the midst of them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He also stimulates them by a consideration of the divine blessings: <span style="font-weight: bold">that you walk worthy of the
vocation in which you are called. </span>You should be attentive to the dignity to which you are
summoned, you ought to behave in a way conformable to it. If someone had been chosen to a
rank of nobility in a kingdom, it would be an indignity for him to perform peasant work. Hence
the Apostle warns the Ephesians, as though he said: You are called to be fellow citizens with the
saints of God&#8217;s household (cf. Eph. 2:19), henceforth it is unworthy of you to engage in earthly
affairs or worry about worldly matters.

 &#8220;You should walk worthy of God, in all things
pleasing&#8221; (Col. 1:10 *); &#8220;let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:27).
And why? Because &#8220;he hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Subsequently, when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">with all humility and mildness, with patience, supporting one
another in charity, </span>he expresses the way [to fulfill] his admonition, teaching them how they can
behave in a worthy manner. Four virtues must be cultivated, and their four opposite vices
shunned.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first vice which he rejects is pride. When one arrogant person decides to rule others, while
the other proud individuals do not want to submit, dissension arises in the society and peace
disappears. Whence Proverbs 13 (10): &#8220;Among the proud there are always contentions.&#8221; To
eliminate this he says <span style="font-weight: bold">with all </span>interior and exterior <span style="font-weight: bold">humility</span>. &#8220;The greater thou art, the more
humble thyself in all things: and thou shalt find grace before God&#8221; (Ecclus. 3:20); &#8220;let nothing
be done through contention, neither by vain glory; but in humility, let each esteem others better
than themselves&#8221; (Phil. 2:3). &#8220;God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble&#8221; (Jas. 4:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Anger is the second vice. For an angry person is inclined to inflict injury, whether verbal or
physical, from which disturbances occur. &#8220;A passionate man stirreth up strifes: he that is patient
appeaseth those who are stirred up&#8221; (Prov. 15:18). To discard it he says <span style="font-weight: bold">with all mildness; </span>this
softens arguments and preserves peace. &#8220;To the meek he will give grace&#8221; (Prov. 3:34); &#8220;The
meek shall inherit the land&#8221; (Ps. 36:11). &#8220;My son, do thy works in meekness: and thou shalt be
beloved above the glory of men&#8221; (Ecclus. 3:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The third is impatience. Occasionally, someone who himself is humble and meek, refraining from
causing trouble, nevertheless will not endure patiently the real or attempted wrongs done to
himself. Therefore, he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">with patience</span> in adversities. Patience hath a perfect work&#8221; (Jas. 1:4),
&#8220;in thy humiliation keep patience&#8221; (Ecclus. 2:4). &#8220;For patience is necessary for you; that, doing
the will of God, you may receive the promise&#8221; (Heb. 10: 36).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">An inordinate zeal is the fourth vice. Inordinately zealous about everything, men will pass
judgment on whatever they see. Not waiting for the proper time and place [to voice their
criticisms], a turmoil arises in society. &#8220;If you bite and devour one another, take heed that you
be not consumed one of another&#8221; (Gal. 5:15). Hence he says <span style="font-weight: bold">supporting one another in charity</span>;
mutually bearing with the defects of others out of charity. When someone falls he should not be
immediately corrected&#8212;unless it is the time and the place for it. With mercy these should be
waited for since &#8220;charity beareth all things&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:7). Not that these failings are tolerated out
of negligence or consent, nor from familiarity or carnal friendship, but from charity. &#8220;Bear ye one
another&#8217;s burdens; and so you shall fulfull the law of Christ&#8221; (Gal. 6:2). &#8220;Now, we that are
stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the weak&#8221; (Rom. 15:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">After this he shows the purpose of his admonition which is to maintain unity among the faithful.
Three points are made:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he sets forth the unity itself which is the goal (4:3a).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">Secondly, he describes bow the unity is kept (4:3b-4a).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, he expresses the reason for preserving this unity (4:4b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">First of all he remarks: You ought to walk worthy of your calling and be <span style="font-weight: bold">careful to keep the
unity of the spirit. </span>Two types of unity exist. One whose purpose is to commit evil; it is wicked
and might be called a unity of the flesh. &#8220;Of one spark cometh a great fire, and of one deceitful
man much blood&#8221; (Ecclus. 11:34). The other is a unity of the spirit; it is good and its purpose is
to do good. &#8220;Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!&#8221; (Ps.
132: 1). &#8220;That they may be one, as we also are&#8221; (Jn. 17:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The way to continue in this unity is through <span style="font-weight: bold">the bond of peace</span>. For charity is a union of souls.
Now the fusion of material objects cannot last unless it is held by some bond. Similarly, the
union of souls through love will not endure unless it is bound. Peace proves to be a true bond;
that peace which is, according to Augustine, the balanced harmony between the measure, form,
and order of a thing.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote2', WPFootnote2 )"><img src="eph4/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote2\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 This is achieved when each possesses what is proper to himself. For this
reason he says <span style="font-weight: bold">in the bond of peace. </span>&#8220;God hath placed peace in thy borders&#8221; (Ps. 147:14). Peace
in its turn is maintained by justice: &#8220;And the work of justice shall be peace&#8221; (Is. 32:17). &#8220;Be not
grieved with her bands&#8221; (Ecclus. 6:26). Why? Because &#8220;in her is the beauty of life: and her bands
are a healthful binding&#8221; (<i>ibid. </i>v. 31).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Now in man there is a twofold unity. The first is the ordered structure of the organs among
themselves, the second is the union of the body and the soul constituting what neither are
separately.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote3', WPFootnote3 )"><img src="eph4/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Because the Apostle speaks of the Church&#8217;s unity after the fashion of the unity
found in man, he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">one body</span> as if to say: Be united in the bond of peace that you may be one
body&#8212;this regards the first type of unity&#8212;all the faithful should be ordered among themselves
as members making up a single body. &#8220;We, being many, are one body in Christ; and every one
members one of another&#8221; (Rom. 12:5). <span style="font-weight: bold">And one spirit</span>&#8212;referring to the second [type of unity
in man]&#8212;that you might possess a spiritual consensus through the unity of your faith and charity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Or: one body designates a unity with other men, and one spirit union with God; because &#8220;he who
is joined to the Lord is one spirit&#8221; (I Cor. 6:17).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next, when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">as you are called in one hope of your calling </span>he points out the reason for
this unity. We notice that when persons are called together to possess something in common and
mutually enjoy it, they usually live and travel together. Thus, in a spiritual way he says: Because
you are called to one and the same reality, namely, the final reward, you ought to walk together
with a unity of spirit <span style="font-weight: bold">in the one hope of your calling, </span>tending toward the one reality you hope
for as a result of your vocation.

</script>
 &#8220;Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation&#8221;
(Heb. 3:1), &#8220;consider your vocation&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:26 *). If anyone asks: Who will call us? And to
what? 1 Peter 5 (10) replies: &#8220;The God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory in
Christ Jesus&#8221; where your true happiness is. &#8220;Blessed are they that are called to the marriage
supper of the Lamb&#8221; (Apoc. 19:9).</p>
<A NAME="2"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">CHAPTER 4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">LECTURE 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">5 One Lord, one faith, one baptism;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-size: 10pt">6 One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in us all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">After he has exhorted them to secure ecclesial unity (4:1), the Apostle offers the Ephesians, in
this section, a glimpse of this unity&#8217;s pattern. Since the Church is likened to a city, it is one and
distinct, although this unity is not uncomposed but composed of different parts. Thus the Apostle
does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he shows what is common in the Church.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he shows what is distinctive [to each member] in her (4:7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The solidarity of any city demands the presence of four common elements: one governor, one
law, the same symbols, and a common goal. The Apostle affirms that these are present in the
Church also.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Hence, he says: You ought to have one body and one spirit since you belong to the one unified
Church. First, she has one leader, Christ. Obeying <span style="font-weight: bold">one Lord, </span>not many, conflicts do not arise
from trying to comply with divergent commands. For Hebrews 3 (6) states: &#8220;Christ [is] as the
Son in his own house.&#8221; &#8220;Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly that God hath
made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have crucified&#8221; (Ac. 2:36). &#8220;There be
lords many; yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things... and one Lord
Jesus Christ, by whom are all things&#8221; (1 Cor. 8:5-6). &#8220;And the Lord shall be king over all the
earth. In that day there shall be one Lord, and his name shall be one&#8221; (Zach. 14:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, her law is one. For the law of the Church is the law of faith: &#8220;Where then is thy
boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith&#8221; (Rom. 3:27). Faith
is sometimes applied to the reality believed in, as with &#8220;This is the Catholic faith...,&#8221;
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote5', WPFootnote5 )"><img src="eph4/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote5" class="WPFloatStyle">' );

  }
</script>
 meaning
this is what must be believed. At other times, <span style="font-weight: bold">faith</span> refers to the habit of faith by which a man
believes what he must in his very heart. <span style="font-weight: bold">Faith </span>in both these senses can be called one.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In the former, <span style="font-weight: bold">one faith </span>would mean that you are bidden to believe in the same truths and live
in the same moral way. For what is believed by all the faithful is one and the same reality, hence
[their faith] is termed Catholic or Universal. &#8220;Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our
Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak,&#8221; that is, think, &#8220;the same thing and that there be no schisms
among you; but that you be perfect in the same mind and in the same judgment&#8221; (1 Cor. 1:10).
In the second way, <span style="font-weight: bold">one faith</span> designates the unity of the habit of faith by which all believe. I mean
that it is specifically one&#8212;not numerically one&#8212;since the same faith is present in each one&#8217;s
heart; just as when many persons want the same thing, they are said to be of one will.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, the Church shares the same symbols. They are Christ&#8217;s sacraments, of which baptism
is the first and the entrance to the rest. Hence he says <span style="font-weight: bold">one baptism. </span>Three reasons account for
this unity. First, baptisms do not differ by reason of who administers them. No matter who
performs the rites they possess an unvaried power because he who baptizes interiorly is one,
namely, Christ. &#8220;He upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and remaining upon him,
he it is that baptizeth with the Holy Ghost&#8221; (Jn. 1:33). Second, baptism is one since it is conferred
in the name of the one Triune God: &#8220;baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
of the Holy Ghost&#8221; (Mt. 28:19). The third reason is that it cannot be repeated. The sacraments
of penance, matrimony, the eucharist and last anointing may be repeated, but not baptism. &#8220;For
it is impossible for those who were once illuminated,&#8221; by baptism, &#8220;have tasted also the heavenly
gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, have moreover tasted the good word of God and
the powers of the world to come, and are fallen away,&#8221; through sins, &#8220;to be renewed again to
penance&#8221; (Heb. 6:4-6). It is not repeated, either by reason of the sacramental character [it
imparts], or because its cause is not repeated: &#8220;For we are buried together with him by baptism
into death; that, as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk
in newness of life&#8221; (Rom. 6:4). And Christ died but once as 1 Peter 3 (18) affirms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Fourthly, the Church has the same goal, God. The Son leads us to the Father: &#8220;when he shall have
delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father; when he shall have brought to nought all
principality and power and virtue&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:24). In reference to this the Apostle adds <span style="font-weight: bold">one God
and Father of all:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he mentions his unity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, his dignity (4:6b),</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Regarding the first he has two remarks. One pertains to the Divine Nature, he says there is one
God: &#8220;Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord&#8221; (Deut. 6:4). The other has to do with his
kindness to us and our piety; whence he says <span style="font-weight: bold">Father of all</span>: &#8220;Thou, O Lord, art our Father, our
Redeemer: from everlasting is thy name&#8221; (Is. 63:16); &#8220;Have we not all one father? Hath not one
God created us?&#8221; (Mal. 2:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He extols Gods dignity on three scores. The Divine Majesty <span style="font-weight: bold">who is above all: </span>&#8220;The Lord is high
above all nations; and his glory above the heavens&#8221; (Ps. 112:4). His power which extends
<span style="font-weight: bold">through all </span>[that exists]: &#8220;Do not I fill heaven and earth, saith the Lord?&#8221; (Jer. 23:24). &#8220;Thou
bast subjected an things under his feet&#8221; (Ps. 8:8). &#8220;All things are delivered to me&#8221; (Lk. 10:22)
since &#8220;all things were made by him&#8221; (Jn. 1:3). Wisdom 11 (21) indicates how this is
accomplished: &#8220;Thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight. For great
power always belonged to thee alone: and who shall resist the strength of thy arm?&#8221; Finally, there
is the abundance of his grace in us all: &#8220;Thou, 0 Lord, art among us, and thy name is called upon
by us&#8221; (Jer. 14:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Majesty is appropriated to the Father who is the source and principle in the Divinity, exceeding
the whole of creation. Power is appropriated to the Son who is that wisdom which &#8220;reacheth from
end to end mightily&#8221; (Wis. 8:1). Grace is appropriated to the Holy Spirit who &#8220;hath filled the
whole world&#8221; (Wis. 1:7).&#8221;

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Previously the Apostle dealt with ecclesial unity in the perspective of what is common within the
Church (4:5), nowwhe manifests this same [unity] from the viewpoint of what is personal and
specific to each of the faithful members of the Church. Concerning this he makes three points:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he points out the fact of distinctions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">Secondly, he introduces a [Scriptural] authority for them (4:8).
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote7', WPFootnote7 )"><img src="eph4/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, he explains this authoritative quotation (4:9).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He states: We have in the Church one God, one faith, one baptism. Nonetheless, each of us has
the diverse graces especially granted to him&#8212;to every one of us is given grace. As though he
said: None of us lack a share in divine grace and communion, &#8220;of his fullness we all have
received; and grace for grace&#8221; (Jn. 1:16). This grace, however, is certainly not bestowed on
everyone uniformly and equally but <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the measure of the giving of Christ. </span>Christ
is the donor who metes out the grace to each, who have &#8220;different gifts according to the grace that
is given us&#8221; (Rom. 12:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The variation does not spring from fate or chance, nor from a difference of merit, but from the
giving of Christ; that is, according as Christ allots it to us. Only he has received the Spirit without
measure (cf. Jn. 3:34); the rest of the saints obtain it in a limited degree, &#8220;according as God hath
divided to every one the measure of faith&#8221; (Rom. 12:3). &#8220;And every man shall receive his own
reward, according to his own labor&#8221; (1 Cor. 3:8). Again, &#8220;to one he gave five talents, and to
another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability&#8221; (Mt. 25:15). just
as it is in Christ&#8217;s power to give or not, so he can grant more or less.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Wherefore he saith </span>(v. 8) introduces an authoritative text from Psalm 67 (19) suporting
<span style="font-weight: bold">according to the measure of the giving of Christ. </span>Three points are made. First, it speaks of
Christ&#8217;s ascension; secondly, of mankind&#8217;s liberation; thirdly, of the bestowal of spiritual gifts.
Each of these will follow in order.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He refers to the ascension saying: <span style="font-weight: bold">Wherefore </span>to signify this the prophet David saith in Psalm 67:
<span style="font-weight: bold">ascending on high</span>... &#8220;For he shall go up that shall open the way before them. They shall divide
and pass through the gate and shall come in by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the
Lord at the head of them&#8221; (Mic. 2:13). Christ &#8220;setteth up his wings on high&#8221; (Job 39:18). He
ascends, I say, but not alone. He led captivity captive, that is, those whom the devil had captured.
For the human race was imprisoned; the saints who had died in love, and so merited eternal
glory, were held like prisoners by the devil in limbo. &#8220;My people led away captive because they
had not knowledge&#8221; (Is. 5:13). Christ liberated these prisoners and brought them with himself
to heaven. &#8220;Shall the prey be taken from the strong? Or can that which was taken by the mighty
be delivered? For thus saith the Lord: Yea verily. Even the captivity shall be taken away from
the strong: and that which was taken by the mighty shall be delivered&#8221; (Is. 49:24-25).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Indeed, this is not only true of those already dead; it also applies to the living. Held under sin&#8217;s
bondage, Christ made men the slaves of justice in delivering them from sin, as Romans 6 (18)
phrases it. Thus in some way he led men captive not unto destruction but salvation. &#8220;From
henceforth thou shalt catch men&#8221; (Lk. 5:10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Besides grasping men from a diabolical slavery and placing them in his own service, he has
enriched them spiritually. Hence he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">he gave gifts</span> of grace and glory <span style="font-weight: bold">to men</span>. &#8220;For God
loveth mercy and truth; the Lord will give grace and glory&#8221; (Ps. 83:12). &#8220;By whom he hath given
us most great and precious promises, that by these you may be made partakers of the divine
nature&#8221; (2 Pet. 1:4). This version [of Ps. 67:19] does not contradict the reading which has &#8220;Thou
hast received gifts in men.&#8221;

 Clearly, he as God bestows the gifts which he as man receives in
the faithful who are his members. In heaven be gives, since he is God, while on earth he accepts
what is given in the manner Matthew 25 (40) describes: &#8220;As long as you did it to one of these my
least brethren, you did it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next he comments on the authority:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, in reference to the ascension.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, regarding what is given men (4: 11)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He does two things concerning the first:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he shows how he descended.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, how he ascended (4: 10).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In reflecting upon the first point, it appears improper for Christ, who is true God, to lower
himself, since nothing is more eminent than God. To remove any doubts on this score the Apostle
asserts, <span style="font-weight: bold">Now, that he ascended, what is it, but because he also descended first. </span>As if he would
say: For this reason do I first mention that he ascended and only afterward that he descended; he
descended in order that he might ascend. For otherwise he could not have ascended.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">How he descended is shown in <span style="font-weight: bold">into the lower parts of the earth, </span>which can be interpreted in
two ways. In one, the lower regions are understood as those parts of the earth we inhabit. It is
lower than the heavens and the atmosphere. The Son of God came down to these sections of the
earth, not by any local movement, but by assuming a lowly, terrestrial nature; according to that
text of Philippians 2 (7): &#8220;He emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the
likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.&#8221; In the second way it can be understood as referring
to hell, which is even below us. He descended thither in his soul that he might free the saints
from it. This seems to agree with the <span style="font-weight: bold">he led captivity captive </span>above. &#8220;Thou also, by the blood
of thy testament, hast sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water&#8221; (Zach. 9:11). I
saw another mighty angel come down from heaven&#8221; (Apoc. 10: 1 ) &#8220;I have seen the affliction of
my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry... And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to
deliver them&#8221; (Ex. 3:7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next (v. 10), three aspects of the ascension are discussed. First, <span style="font-weight: bold">He that descended in the same
also that ascended</span> indicates the person who ascends. It affirms the unity of person [in the two
natures of Christ], the divine and the human.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote9', WPFootnote9 )"><img src="eph4/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For he who descended, as was said, is the Son
of God taking on human nature. He who ascends is the Son of man, raising human nature to the
preeminence of immortal life. Thus the Son of God who descended and the Son of man who
ascended are identical: &#8220;And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended from
heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven&#8221; (Jn. 3:13). Notice too how the humble who voluntarily
lower themselves, spiritually ascend to the grandeur of God: &#8220;he that humbleth himself shall be
exalted&#8221; (Lk. 14:11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, <span style="font-weight: bold">above all the heavens </span>denotes the destination of the ascension. &#8220;He mounteth above
the heaven of heavens, to the east&#8221; (Ps. 67:34). This should not be understood simply in reference
to an ascension above the physical heavens, it also refers to every spiritual creature. God has set
Christ &#8220;on his right band in the heavenly places. Above all principality and power and virtue and
dominion and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come&#8221;
(Eph. 1:20-21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, the fruitful outcome of the ascension is <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might fill all things, </span>bestowing on every
race of men the fullness of spiritual gifts. &#8220;We shall be filled with the good things of thy house&#8221;
(Ps. 64:5); &#8220;Come over to me, all ye that desire me, and be filled with my fruits&#8221; (Ecclus. 24:26).
Or, <span style="font-weight: bold">that he might fulfill, </span>that is, put into effect all things written concerning himself: &#8220;all things
must needs be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the
psalms, concerning me&#8221; (Lk. 24:44).</p>
<A NAME="4"><p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">CHAPTER 4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">LECTURE 4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">11 And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 10pt">12 For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-size: 10pt">13 Until we all meet into the unity of faith and of the knowlege<span style="text-decoration: underline"> </span>of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the
measure of the age of the fulness of Christ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Here the Apostle expounds what was mentioned earlier (4:9) about the bestowal of gifts.
Concerning this he makes two points:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he shows that the Lord has imparted a variety of gifts on each of the faithful.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he indicates the utility and fruitfulness of these gifts (4:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The many different states and functions in the Church are designated as the gifts of Christ.
Consider how, among the gifts of Christ, the Apostles are conceded the first place: <span style="font-weight: bold">And he gave
some Apostles</span>. &#8220;And he chose twelve of them whom also he named apostles&#8221; (Lk. 6:13). &#8220;God
indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that
miracles...&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:28).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Apostles are put first because they had a privileged share in all of Christs gifts. They possessed
a plenitude of grace and wisdom regarding the revelation of divine mysteries. Christ &#8220;opened
their understanding that they might understand the scriptures&#8221; (Lk. 24:45). &#8220;To you it is given
to know the mystery of the kingdom of God&#8221; (Mk. 4:11). &#8220;Because all things, whatsoever I have
heard of my Father, I have made known to you&#8221; (Jn. 15:15). They also possessed an ample ability
to speak convincingly in order to proclaim the gospel. I will give you a mouth and wisdom,
which all your adversaries shall not be able to resist and gainsay&#8221; (Lk. 21:15). &#8220;Go ye unto the
whole world and preach the gospel to every creature&#8221; (Mk. 16:15). Moreover, they also had an
exceptional authority and power for looking after the Lord&#8217;s flock. &#8220;Feed my sheep&#8221; (Jn. 21:17).
&#8220;For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto
edification and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed&#8221; (2 Cor. 10: 8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, the Apostle adds three ecclesiastical categories according as they share in each of the
foregoing. Related to the revelation of divine mysteries he annexes <span style="font-weight: bold">and some prophets </span>who
foretold the incarnation of Christ. Of them 1 Peter 1 (10*) declares: &#8220;Of which salvation the
prophets have inquired and diligently searched, who prophesied of the glory to come in you.&#8221;
&#8220;For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John&#8221; (Mt. 11:13). But after Christ came, the
apostles became the prophets of the joy of the life to come. &#8220;Blessed is he that readeth and
heareth the words of this prophecy, and keepeth those things which are written in it; for the time
is at hand&#8221; (Apoc. 1:3). They also became the interpreters of what the ancient prophets had
foretold. &#8220;Be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:1). &#8220;Behold
I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes; and some of them you will put to death&#8221; (Mt.
23:34).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Relative to the proclamation of the gospel he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">some evangelists</span>. They had the duty of
preaching the good news, and even of writing it down although they were not among the
principal apostles. &#8220;How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, of them
that bring glad tidings of good things!&#8221; (Rom. 10:15). &#8220;To Jerusalem I will give an evangelist&#8221;
(Is. 41:27).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In reference to the care of the Church he says some pastors who are responsible for the Lord&#8217;s
flock. Under the same heading he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">and doctors </span>to bring out how the pastor&#8217;s specific task
in the Church is to instruct the people in what pertains to faith and good conduct. The
administration of temporalities does not belong to bishops, who are the successors of the
Apostles, but rather to deacons. &#8220;It is not reasonable that we should leave the word of God, and
serve tables&#8221; (Ac. 6:2). &#8220;Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may
be able to exhort in sound doctrine&#8221; (Tit. 1:9). The words of Jeremias 3 (15) apply to bishops:
&#8220;I will give you pastors according to my own heart, and they shall feed you with knowledge and
doctrine.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next (v. 12), he discloses the fruitful results of these gifts or functions. Concerning this he does
two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he speaks of their fruit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he explains how the faithful may attain to this fruit (4:14).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first section has two divisions also:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he sets down their immediate result.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, their ultimate fruit (4:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The proximate effects of the above mentioned gifts or functions are threefold. First, consider
those who are placed in these functions; spiritual gifts are communicated to them that they might
be at the service of God and their fellow man. Thus he states <span style="font-weight: bold">for the work of the ministry </span>which
offers honor to God and salvation to one&#8217;s fellow men. &#8220;Let a man so account of us as of the
ministers of Christ and the dispensers of the mysteries of God&#8221; (I Cor. 4:1). &#8220;You shall be called
the priests of the Lord; to you it shall be said: Ye ministers of our God&#8221; (Is. 61:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, consider the perfection of those who already believe; so be says for <span style="font-weight: bold">the perfecting of
the saints</span>, that is, of those already sanctified through faith in Christ. Prelates must be especially
anxious to lead those intrusted to them toward the state of perfection. This is why Dionysius
claims, in his <i>Ecclesiastica Hierarchia</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote10', WPFootnote10 )"><img src="eph4/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
<i> </i>that they are to be all the more perfect. &#8216;Wherefore,
leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to things more perfect; not laying again
the foundation of penance from dead works and of faith towards God&#8221; (Heb. 6: 1). &#8220;The
consumption abridged shall overflow with justice. For the Lord God of hosts shall make a
consumption, and an abridgment in the midst of all the land&#8221; (Is. 10:22).
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote11', WPFootnote11 )"><img src="eph4/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">A third [immediate effect] is the conversion of the unbelievers. About this he states <span style="font-weight: bold">for the
edifying of the body of Christ. </span>When the infidels are converted, Christ&#8217;s Church&#8212;which is his
body&#8212;is built up. Whoever preaches &#8220;speaketh to men unto edification and exhortation and
comfort&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:3). &#8220;For greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues;
unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification... So you also, forasmuch as
you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:5,12).

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He goes on (v. 13) to discuss the ultimate fruit [of the Church&#8217;s preaching] which can be
understood in two ways. One sees it as touching on the absolutely ultimate effect: the resurrection
of the saints. In this perspective two facts are asserted. First is the spiritual and corporeal
convergence [<i>congregatio</i>]<i> </i>of all who have risen. The physical convergence will consist in this,
that all the saints will be drawn together toward Christ: &#8220;Wheresoever the body shall be, there
shall the eagles also be gathered together&#8221; (Mt. 24:28).
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote13', WPFootnote13 )"><img src="eph4/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote13\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Concerning this he says <span style="font-weight: bold">until we all
meet, </span>as if to say: The above ministry, the perfecting of the saints, and the edifying of the Church
will continue until we all meet Christ in the resurrection. &#8220;Behold, the bridegroom cometh. Go
ye forth to meet him&#8221; (Mt. 25:6). &#8220;Be prepared to meet thy God, O Israel&#8221; (Am. 4:12). We shall
meet one another also: &#8220;We who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them
[those who have died] in the clouds to meet Christ&#8221; (1 Thess. 4:16). &#8220;If by any means I may
attain to the resurrection which is from the dead&#8221; (Phil. 3: 11).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The spiritual convergence, however, is seen in relation to our merits, which is according to the
same faith; regarding this he says <span style="font-weight: bold">into the unity of faith. </span>There is only &#8220;one Lord, one faith&#8221;
(Eph. 4:5). Again he said earlier: &#8220;Careful to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace&#8221;
(Eph. 4:3). <span style="font-weight: bold">The knowledge of the Son of God </span>is the reward, it consists in the perfect vision and
knowledge of God of which 1 Corinthians 13 (12) speaks: &#8220;Then shall I know even as I am
known.&#8221; &#8220;And they shall teach no more every man his neigbbour, and every man his brother,
saying: Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least of them even to the greatest&#8221; (Jer.
31:34).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he discusses the aforementioned fruit in respect to the perfection of those who rise. He
relates first of all the perfection itself when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">unto a perfect man</span>. This should not be
understood as though women will be changed into men at the resurrection&#8212;some have misread
it in such a fashion. Both sexes will remain, though sexual intercourse will no longer occur, as
our Lord indicates in Matthew 22 (30): &#8220;For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be
married, but shall be as the angels of God in heaven.&#8221; [They will remain as a witness] to the
perfection of nature, and for the glory of God who created such a nature. The perfect man
designates the complete and total perfection of that state. &#8220;When that which is perfect is come,
that which is in part shall be done away&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:10). Thus man is used here rather in
contradistinction to boy than as the opposite of woman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He describes, in the second place, the exemplar of this perfection when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">unto the
measure of the age of the fullness of Christ. </span>Consider how the true physical body of Christ is
the exemplar of his mystical body. Both are made up of many members joined into a unified
whole. Now the physical body of Christ grew to the mature and robust age of thirty-three years
before he died. Therefore, the age of the risen saints, who will experience neither imperfection
nor the failings of old age, will correspond to that mature age. &#8220;He will reform the body of our
lowness, made like to the body of his glory&#8221; (Phil. 3:21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In another way [this passage, v. 13] can be understood as referring to the ultimate fruit [of the
Churchs ministry] in the present life. This will happen when all the faithful come to her in the
unity of faith and the knowledge of the truth. &#8220;And other sheep I have that are not of this fold;
them also I must bring. And they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold and one
shepherd&#8221; (Jn. 10:16). In this the mystical body is perfected spiritually in a manner similar to [the
physical perfection of] Chrises natural body. In this perspective, the whole body of the Church
is termed a manly body, following the metaphor used by the Apostle in Galatians 4 (1): &#8220;Now,
I say: As long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all.&#8221;

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Having spoken of the diversity of spiritual gifts and their fruit (4:12), now the Apostle describes
bow we attain to that fruit. Concerning this he does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he removes two obstacles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he teaches the way of gaining access to them (4:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">It was stated well, he says, that the ultimate fruit of these gifts is for us to meet the Lord as a
&#8220;Perfect man unto the measure of the age of Christ.&#8221; We are obliged <span style="font-weight: bold">henceforth </span>to cease being
children and become mature men; for as long as a person is a boy he is not a perfect man.
Whoever is to meet the Lord must leave his childhood behind. The Apostle did just that: &#8220;When
I became a man, I put away the things of a child&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:11). It is a quality of the child never
to be fixed or determinate in anything, he rather believes whatever is told him. To act like grown
men we have to abandon a fickle oscillation and instability in our judgments. &#8220;Do not become
children mentally; in malice be children but in your mind be mature&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:20*). Those who
waver are called such from the word &#8220;wave&#8221;; like a wave <span style="font-weight: bold">tossed to and fro</span> they are not firm in
the faith. &#8220;He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the
wind&#8221; (Jas. 1:6). But now it is imperative for us to stand firm and not fluctuate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Evil teachings are like the wind Proverbs 25 (23*) speaks of with merit: &#8220;The north wind brings
forth rain.&#8221; &#8220;And the rain fell, and the floods came and the winds blew; and they beat upon that
house. And it fell; and great was the fall thereof&#8221; (Mt. 7:27). Hence he warns against being
carried about with every wind of doctrine. As though he said: We must not be shaken by these
wicked doctrines that buff about seeking to agitate hearts and ruin spiritual accomplishments.
Three qualities demonstrate that it is not good doctrine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">First, its source is <span style="font-weight: bold">from the wickedness of men. </span>Not being sound doctrine, but false and wicked,
someone will concoct dogmas out of it in order to wield dominion over others, even though souls
are lost. Such were the teachings of that most wicked Arius whose abdomen burst asunder [at his
death].

 He could be made the subject of a discourse on Ecclesiasticus 31 (29*) &#8220;The testimony
of his wickedness is true.&#8221; Second, its methods are by <span style="font-weight: bold">cunning craftiness</span> to mean one thing and
pretend to hold some other opinion. On this account the Apostle wrote the Corinthians: &#8220;I fear
lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted and fall from
the simplicity that is in Christ&#8221; (2 Cor. 11:3). Third, this is also evident from its effects, for such
doctrine <span style="font-weight: bold">lies in wait to deceive</span>. Its teachers seduce and lie in wait, not to rob money or temporal
goods, but to spread errors. &#8220;Evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse; erring, and
driving into error&#8221; (2 Tim. 3:13).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Having pointed out the impediments [of immaturity and erroneous doctrine] which prevent one
from acquiring the fruit of spiritual gifts, he discloses here how that fruit can be attained. He
argues this way: It was said just now that to obtain the fruit of these spiritual gifts we must stop
being children and grow up into mature adults. As long as we are childish we have not reached
a mature state, neither do we grow. Hence, it is necessary for us to grow up. This is what be says
about <span style="font-weight: bold">doing the truth in charity </span>where he makes two points:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, in what areas we ought to grow up.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, through whom [we are to grow] (4:15b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">With respect to the first he states <span style="font-weight: bold">doing the truth in charity we may grow up</span> in good works
and the form of good works, which two are truth and charity.

</script>
 Any good work is at times
referred to as truth, for instance, Tobias 1 (2): &#8220;Even in his captivity he forsook not the way of
truth.&#8221; Let us, therefore, do the truth, namely, every good work. Or, put true doctrine into practice
since it is not enough simply to hear or teach the truth, it must be acted on as well. Thus the
Apostle counsels Timothy: &#8220;Take heed to thyself and to doctrine; be earnest in them. For in doing
this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee&#8221; (1 Tim. 4:16). &#8220;Be ye doers of the word
and not hearers only&#8221; (Jas. 1:22) since &#8220;doers shall be justified&#8221; (Rom. 2:13). That is, if they act
out of charity, the form of good works. &#8220;Do manfully and be strengthened. Let all your actions
be done in charity&#8221; (1 Cor. 16:13-14); otherwise they will be useless: &#8220;If I should distribute all
my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity,
it profiteth me nothing&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:3).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Because not to make progress in the approach to God is itself a retrogression, the Apostle adds
that <span style="font-weight: bold">we may grow up in him, </span>(v. 15b) where be states three points by explaining:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, the author of our development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">Secondly, the truth about him (4:16a).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, the manner of the development (4:16b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He asks that <span style="font-weight: bold">we may grow up in him, </span>namely, in Christ, of whom 1 Peter 2 (2 *) declares: &#8220;In
him may you grow unto salvation.&#8221; In him, I repeat, who is the head, Christ, and in the Church
which is his body (cf. Col. 1:24). Let us increase, not in wealth as was said of Job that &#8220;his
possession hath increased on the earth&#8221; (Job 1:10), but in spiritual goods. Nor in one area only,
but in all things, that is, being fruitful and increasing in every good. &#8220;Whatsoever else you do,
do all to the glory of God... As I also in all things please all men&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:31, 33). The Apostle
commends the Corinthians on this score: &#8220;Now, I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are
mindful of me and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you&#8221; (1 Cor. 11:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next (v. 16b), he speaks about the truth of Christ through whom we ought to grow. Three points
concerning an organic body are to be kept in mind: its organs are interrelated, they are bound
together by tendons, each member serves the rest. &#8220;If the foot should say: because I am not the
hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear should say: because I
am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were the
eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?&#8221; (1
Cor. 12:15-17). Therefore, one body is composed of many members in these three ways: through
its structured whole or unity, through its connective bindings, and through its reciprocal actions
and assistance, just as all these actions of interrelating organs, the connecting of tendons, and
movements take their initiative from the body&#8217;s head, so the spiritual counterparts of these flow
from Christ, our head, into his body, the Church.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">First, there is a structured unity through faith. Whence he says <span style="font-weight: bold">from Christ </span>who is our head, as
was already mentioned, <span style="font-weight: bold">the whole body, being compacted </span>is joined together in a unity. &#8220;He will
gather together the dispersed of Israel&#8221; (Ps. 146:2). &#8220;He will gather together unto him all nations,
and heap together unto him all people&#8221; (Hab. 2:5). Christ is &#8220;the head, from which the whole
body, by joints and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth unto the
increase of God&#8221; (Col. 2:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Second, a connecting and binding force emanates from Christ, the head, into his body, the
Church, since whatever is united must be held together or bound by some nexus or bond. On this
account he says <span style="font-weight: bold">fitly joined together, by what every joint supplieth, </span>that is, through the faith
and charity which unite and knit the members of the mystical body to one another for their
mutual support. &#8220;All the works of the Lord are good: and he will furnish every work in due time&#8221;
(Ecclus. 39:39). Thus the Apostle himself, confident of this mutual being-of-service which reigns
among the members of the Church due to the divine unifying action, had said: &#8220;I know that this
shall happen to me unto salvation, through your prayer and the assistance of the Spirit of Jesus
Christ&#8221; (Phil. 1:19 *).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Third, from Christ the head there is infused into his members the power to act in order that they
may grow spiritually. For this reason he states <span style="font-weight: bold">according to the operation in the measure of
every part, maketh increase of the body. </span>As if he said: Not only is the structured unity of the
members of the Church through faith, and their connection or being joined together through the
mutual service of charity, from Christ the head. Indeed, from him comes the actual operation or
movements of the members needed for action, and this according to the measure and competency
of each member. Thus he asserts that Christ accomplishes the increase <span style="font-weight: bold">of the body according
to the operation</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">in the </span>due <span style="font-weight: bold">measure of every part. </span>Therefore, the body not only grows
through the faith which compacts it into a structured whole and through charity&#8217;s mutual
assistance, but also through the actual binding force which flows out from each member
according to the degree of grace given him; and also through the actual impulse to act which God
effects in us.

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">But why does God make each member grow? To build up the body. &#8220;In whom all the building,
being framed together, groweth up into an holy temple in the Lord. In whom you also are built
together into an habitation of God in the Spirit&#8221; (Eph. 2:21-22). So 1 Corinthians 3 (9) affirms

<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, near the end of the Letter (6: 10) he shows them where they can find the strength

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first section has two parts:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he sets down precepts for everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he adds certain ones pertaining to particular classes within the Church (5:22).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he treats of particular ones (4:25).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Again, the first section has two parts. Since the Apostles&#8217; intention is to draw them away from
their old customs to embrace Christ&#8217;s new teaching:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: -0.240833in; margin-left: 0.5in">First, he demonstrates how the doctrine of Christ is just the opposite of the old pagan
perversity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he offers them incentives to leave it behind and adopt the way of Christ (4:22).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first of these has two sections:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he describes the pagans&#8217;way of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he shows that Christ&#8217;s teaching is contrary to it (4:20).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The first part has three divisions:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">First, he exhorts them to reject the pagan way of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in">Secondly, he describes it in reference to the pagan&#8217;s inner mind (4:18),.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.259167in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, he does so in reference to his external way of acting (4:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">That you will be able to carry out, he says, what I have spoken of above, I say, not beseeching
you as previously, rather I say and testify to what I have asserted. I testify again to every man
circumcising himself that he is a debtor to the whole law&#8221; (Gal. 5:3). &#8220;1 charge thee, before God
and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead...&#8221; (2 Tim. 4:1). And what [does he bear
witness to here]? <span style="font-weight: bold">That henceforward</span>, from the moment you believed and were converted to
Christ, since you &#8220;are [now] clean&#8221; (Jn. 13:10), <span style="font-weight: bold">you walk not as also the Gentiles walk. To
walk</span> here means to live: &#8220;If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit&#8221; (Gal. 5:25). This
should not be <span style="font-weight: bold">as the Gentiles walk: </span>&#8220;You know that, when you were heathens, you went to
dumb idols according as you were led&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:2). You must not walk in such a manner: &#8220;My
son, walk not with them: restrain thy foot from their paths&#8221; (Prov.1:15).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Then, in saying <span style="font-weight: bold">in the vanity of their mind, </span>he gives the reason for his prohibition. Note that
to walk spiritually is to make progress. &#8220;The path of the just is right to walk in&#8221; (Is. 26:27), and
to Abraham it was said: &#8220;Walk before me, and be perfect&#8221; (Gen. 17:1). There are three norms
immanent in man by which he must be guided and regulated if he is to walk justly and make
spiritual progress. In man, one of these is the reason which judges about what is to be done in
concrete circumstances.

 Another is the understanding of universal principles, called synderesis;
and thirdly, there is the divine law or God. Actions are good and meritorious when the person is
guided by these three in their proper interrelations; namely, when the action is in accord with the
judgment of reason, and this reason judges according to true understanding, or synderesis; and
this synderesis is, in turn, directed by the divine law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The life of the Gentiles did not resemble this, it was lacking these three. First of all, rational
judgment was missing since they <span style="font-weight: bold">walked in the vanity of their mind. Mind</span> here is the power
to apprehend [<i>vis apprehensiva</i>]<i> </i>through which we judge about individual objects. Hence, a man
is called upright when he judges correctly about what should be done. But this mind is sometimes
upright, and at other times vain. It is termed upright when, guided by appropriate norms, it attains
to the proper end; it is vain when, led by the wrong norms, it does not achieve the proper end.
&#8220;All men are vain, in whom there is not the knowledge of God&#8221; (Wis. 13:1), &#8220;because they
became vain in their thoughts&#8221; (Rom. 1:21) &#8220;and walked after vanity and are become vain&#8221; (Jer.
2:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Why? Obviously because in performing such acts their reason is not guided by an enlightened
understanding, but an erroneous one. This is what he says about them <span style="font-weight: bold">having their
understanding darkened. </span>&#8220;Their foolish heart was darkened&#8221; (Rom. 1:21), and &#8220;they have not
known nor understood: they walk on in darkness&#8221; (Ps. 81:5). This is traceable to their not sharing
in the divine light, or not being enlightened and directed by the divine law. Thus he adds
<span style="font-weight: bold">alienated from the life of God, </span>from God who is the life of the soul. I am the way, and the truth,
and the life&#8221; (Jn. 14:6).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Or, <span style="font-weight: bold">from the life of God </span>may mean from charity and spiritual grace by which the soul lives
formally [a supernatural life]. &#8220;The grace of God is life everlasting&#8221; (Rom. 6:23). Existing
without an expectation of eternal life, they held for a mortality of the soul contrary to faith and
hope. &#8220;And they knew not the secrets of God, nor hoped for the wages of justice, nor esteemed
the honour of holy souls&#8221; (Wis. 2:22). Or again, <span style="font-weight: bold">from the life of God </span>might indicate an existence
estranged from that holy living which comes through faith: I live, now not I; but Christ liveth in
me&#8221; (Gal. 2:20). &#8220;The just man liveth by faith&#8221; (Rom. 1: 17). Or, the life which comes through
charity: &#8220;We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren&#8221; (1 Jn.
3:14). [The pagans] were not likethis; instead, they were alienated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He briefly discusses the quality of this alienation, it is <span style="font-weight: bold">through the ignorance that is in them,
</span>not of stars or the movement of the constellations, but of the Divine Nature. &#8220;Some have not the
knowledge of God&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:34), since in former times God was known only among the Jews.
But &#8220;God, indeed having winked at the times of this ignorance, now declareth unto men that all
should everywhere do penance&#8221; (Ac. 17:30). God, insofar as he himself was concerned, was not
the cause of this ignorance since &#8220;That which is known of God is manifest in them. For God hath
manifested it unto them&#8221; (Rom. 1: 19). Certainly the cause was themselves due to the <span style="font-weight: bold">blindness
of their hearts. </span>He describes it well as blindness since from created reality they could not attain
to a knowledge of the Creator. &#8220;For their own malice blinded them. And they knew not the
secrets of God, nor hoped for the wages of justice&#8221; (Wis. 2:21-22).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Then the Apostle goes on (v. 19) to portray how their exterior manner of life was once they lost
hope, a loss due to their alientation from life. &#8220;I have done with hope. I shall now live no longer&#8221;
(Job 7:16). &#8220;And they said: We have no hopes; for we will go after our own thoughts and we will
do everyone according to the perverseness of his evil heart&#8221; (Jer. 18:12). This is what follows in
that they have <span style="font-weight: bold">given themselves up to lasciviousness unto the working of all uncleanness,
unto covetousness</span>. The text can be read in two ways. <span style="font-weight: bold">Unto covetousness</span> may be taken as a
separate vice meaning they were avaricious: &#8220;Being filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication,
avarice...&#8221; (Rom. 1:29). &#8220;Let your manners be without covetousness, contented with such things
as you have&#8221; (Heb. 13:5). For &#8220;nothing is more wicked than the covetous man&#8221; (Ecclus. 10:9).
Thus Habacuc 2 (9): &#8220;Woe to him that gathereth together an evil covetousness to his house that
his nest may be on high, and thinketh he may be delivered out of the hand of evil.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Unto covetousness</span> might also be joined with what goes before, meaning &#8220;covetously&#8221; and
modify the preceding. In that case their life was weighted down with a triple burden. First, they
did not sin from passion but by choice, thus he says they have given themselves up to
lasciviousness. As though he had said: Instead of sinning through passion or weakness they just
sold themselves over to it: &#8220;Assemble ye all that are in the city, that we may of our own accord
yield ourselves all up to the people of Holofernes&#8221; (Jdt. 7:15). &#8220;They have not done penance for
the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, that they have committed&#8221; (2 Cor. 12:21).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, [their sins were aggravated] from the complete lack of restraint; they &#8220;walk after the
flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government&#8221; (2 Pet. 2:10). Therefore, he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">unto
the working of all uncleaness; </span>&#8220;these men have placed their uncleannesses in their hearts, and
have set up before their face the stumbling-block of their iniquity&#8221; (Ez. 14:3). Thirdly, their sin
was greater from its continuance, for they sinned incessantly. &#8220;They have committed fornication
and have not ceased: because they have forsaken the Lord in not observing his law&#8221; (Os. 4:10).
Whence he states unto covetousness, that is, [they sinned] ardently, with a constant and insatiable
appetite for more. &#8220;Having eyes full of adultery and of sin that ceaseth not; alluring unstable
souls; having their heart exercised with covetousness; children of malediction. Leaving the right
way they have gone astray&#8221; (2 Pet. 2:14-15).</p>

Christ&#8217;s teaching is completely contrary to such a way of life and condition. Because some men
who distorted Christian doctrine held there is no life after the present one, but that man&#8217;s soul, like
the rest of the animals, dies with his body, the Apostle makes clear:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in">First, that Christ&#8217;s teaching is contrary to their former life and condition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thus he affirms: It was said that they, despairing, gave themselves up to lust, <span style="font-weight: bold">But you have not
learned </span>that <span style="font-weight: bold">Christ </span>is to be so imitated. How should he be? &#8220;You yourselves have been taught by
God that you must love one another&#8221; (1 Thess. 4:9). &#8220;Therefore, brethren, stand fast; and hold the
traditions which you have learned&#8221; (2 Thess. 2:14 *). And how shall we retain them? &#8220;When you
had received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not as the word of men, but, as
it is indeed, the word of God, who worketh in you that have believed&#8221; (1 Thess. 2:13). Therefore,
&#8220;Rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the faith, as also you have learned; abounding in him
in thanksgiving&#8221; (Col. 2:7).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">This certainly will happen <span style="font-weight: bold">if you have heard him</span>, for hearing is the servant of instruction. <span style="font-weight: bold">If</span> here
is the equivalent of &#8220;because.&#8221; &#8220;And this is the declaration which you have heard, as 1 John 1 (5)
expresses it in reference to the proclamation of the faith. &#8220;He that harkeneth to me shall not be
confounded&#8221; (Ecclus. 24:30). And &#8220;the ear that heareth the reproofs of life shall abide in the midst
of the wise. He that rejecteth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that yieldeth to reproof
possesseth understanding&#8221; (Prov. 15:3132). <span style="font-weight: bold">If</span> also <span style="font-weight: bold">you have been taught in him</span> how what
pertains to faith must be kept and fulfilled. &#8220;They did as they were taught&#8221; (Mt. 28:15), <span style="font-weight: bold">as the
truth is in Jesus</span>.<span style="font-weight: bold"> </span>As though he said: If you have heard the faith of Christ preached and how this
faith must be put into practice, you have been taught what Jesus is like, he is himself the truth
which is imparted to you. You must not, therefore, behave as those who despair.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">How should they live? He adds <span style="font-weight: bold">to put off, according to the former way of life, the old man. </span>The
passage has two variant readings.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote21', WPFootnote21 )"><img src="eph4/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 One is the infinitive, <span style="font-weight: bold">to put off</span>; then it would be construed
with what preceded to read: The truth about which you were instructed in Jesus was to put off the
old man. The more common reading has an imperative, <span style="font-weight: bold">put ye off</span>; in this case the signification
is: Since the life and teachings of the Gentiles are contrary to those of Jesus, in which you have
been taught, the only alternative is that you discard the old man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Hence he makes two points here since vices must first be eradicated before virtues can be
cultivated:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in">First, he instructs them to put aside their former condition, their old way of living.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, how they must take on a new way of life [characteristic] of Jesus (4:23).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Three considerations follow. First, what does <span style="font-weight: bold">the old man</span> mean? Some hold that the old man is
external and the new man interior. But it must be said that the old man is both interior and exterior;
he is a person who is enslaved by a senility in his soul, due to sin, and in his body whose members
provide the tools for sin. Thus a man enslaved to sin in soul and body is an old man. He is already
on the way to corruption, or is actually beginning to decay since &#8220;that which decayeth and groweth
old is near its end&#8221; (Heb. 8:13). And so a man subjected to sin is termed an old man because he is
on the way to corruption. On this account he goes on, <span style="font-weight: bold">corrupted according to the desire of error.
</span>Anything will corrupt when it deviates from the order of its inner being. Man&#8217;s nature longs for
what accords with reason; and truth is reason&#8217;s perfection and good. Hence, when someone&#8217;s
reason sways toward error, and his desire is corrupted from this error, he is referred to as an old
man.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">This, he says, is <span style="font-weight: bold">according to</span> evil <span style="font-weight: bold">desire</span>. &#8220;Make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences&#8221;
(Rom. 13:14). &#8220;Many [are the] unprofitable and hurtful desires which drown men into destruction
and perdition7 (1 Tim. 6:9). Some people are lured into these cravings through their own weakness.
Malice will draw others to them, as it does those who say that God does not have a providential
care [of the universe].

 Therefore he adds <span style="font-weight: bold">of error</span> because the mind and affections of those who
maliciously err become corrupted. Possibly the <span style="font-weight: bold">desire of error </span>refers to whatever makes men err,
according to Wisdom 2 (21): &#8220;These things they thought, and were deceived: for their own malice
blinded them,&#8221; and in Proverbs 14 (8): &#8220;The imprudence of fools erreth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In Colossians 3 (9) the Apostle indicates how to leave the old man behind: &#8220;Stripping yourselves
of the old man with his deeds.&#8221; The substance of human nature is not to be rejected or despoiled,
but only wicked actions and conduct. &#8220;Have your manner of life good among the Gentiles&#8221; (1 Pet.
2:12* ); &#8220;Be thou an example of the faithful, in word, in conduct, in charity, in faith, in chastity&#8221;
(1 Tim. 4:12*).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next (v. 23), he indicates the new condition they are to take on. In doing three things concerning
this, he shows:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in">First, through what means we can obtain this newness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in">Secondly, in whom this newness resides (4:24a).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, what the newness is (4:24b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Regarding the first he says <span style="font-weight: bold">be renewed in the spirit of your mind. </span>Notice that although <span style="font-weight: bold">spirit </span>is
frequently said to be in man, nevertheless three spirits are discernible in him. One is the Holy
Spirit: &#8220;Know you not that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?&#8221;
(1 Cor. 3:16). Another is his spiritual reason: &#8220;For the flesh lusteth against the spirit; and the spirit
against the flesh&#8221; (Gal. 5:17). Finally, there is man&#8217;s imaginative spirit: &#8220;Know ye, 0 Israel, that
the prophet was foolish, the man was mad, and spiritual&#8221; (Os. 9:7 *), that is, his imagination went
wild.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, the <span style="font-weight: bold">spirit of your mind </span>may point to the Holy Spirit. He then states that the cause of
renewal is the Holy Spirit who dwells in our rational spirit: &#8220;God hath sent the Spirit of his Son
into your hearts&#8221; (Gal. 4:6). &#8220;Send forth thy Spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew
the face of the earth&#8221; (Ps. 103:30). Or <span style="font-weight: bold">spirit </span>could refer to the rational spirit and would be identical
with our <span style="font-weight: bold">mind</span>, similar to the expression in Colossians 2 (11): &#8220;In despoiling of the body of the
flesh,&#8221; that is, the body which the flesh is. Likewise here, <span style="font-weight: bold">in the spirit of your mind</span> would refer
to the spirit which the mind is. He would qualify it in this way since there is another spirit within
us, differing from the mind, and which is common to both us and the beasts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">However, he states <span style="font-weight: bold">be renewed in the spirit of your mind</span>; what is not spoiled keeps its freshness
and does not require a renewal. If Adam had not become tainted neither he nor ourselves would
need a renovation. Yet, once he was corrupted, both he and his offspring are in need of a
renovation.  In the present life we must be renewed in soul; our body will be in the future when
&#8220;this corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal must put on immortality&#8221; (1 Cor. 15:52).
Hence he says be renewed in the spirit since, unless the spirit is renewed in this life, the body will
never be renewed. Or, in the spirit of your mind can be interpreted as in your mind which was made
spiritual and will return to the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">And put on the new man </span>discloses in whom this renewal takes place. Adam introduced sin into
all men, and thus became for everything the primary source of oldness. Likewise, the primary
source of newness and renovation is Christ. In Adam all die and in Christ all will be brought back
to life. &#8220;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but a new
creature&#8221; (Gal. 6:15). Therefore, &#8220;Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ&#8221; (Rom. 13:14).</p>

renovation is. It admits of a triple explanation. If the who refers to [man&#8217;s] spirit, it would mean:
The spirit, which our mind is, was created by God in the freshness of original justice; or, by a
second creative act was renewed to be just again: &#8220;Created in Christ Jesus in good works&#8221; (Eph.
2:10). Or, the who might have reference to the new man, Christ. Then the text could be construed
as: <span style="font-weight: bold">Who is created, </span>that is, formed in the Virgin&#8217;s womb according to God by the Holy Spirit and
not human seed. Or, he was created according to an existence of grace, as well as a fullness in
justice toward men and a holiness before God that was not fictitious but of truth: &#8220;In holiness and
justice before him&#8221; (Lk. 1:75). It could rather mean that holiness is in his heart, truth on his tongue,
and justice in his actions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Regarding the first of these he does three things. First, he forbids one of them; then he urges its
opposite [virtue]; thirdly, he gives his reason. Hence, he first prohibits what is characteristic of the
old man, thereby expounding what he said above (v. 24): &#8220;Put on the new man.&#8221; To accomplish
this he first bans lying because through this sin of the tongue the truth of reason is corrupted.
<span style="font-weight: bold">Wherefore</span> to put on the new man you should be <span style="font-weight: bold">putting away lying, </span>for &#8220;Thou [O Lord] wilt
destroy all that speak a lie&#8221; (Ps. 5:7) maliciously.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Then he urges them on to newness of life, saying with Zacharias (8:16) <span style="font-weight: bold">speak ye the truth, every
man with his neighbor. </span>And why? Because we are members of one another. For members are to
love and mutually assist one another in truth. &#8220;We, being many, are one body in Christ; and every
one members one of another&#8221; (Rom. 12:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">When forbidding sins destructive of the order in the irascible emotions, be makes three points:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in">First, he gives a warning.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in">Secondly, he explains.what he means (4:26b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thirdly, he gives the reason for his concern (4:27).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">He gives his warning when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">Be angry, and sin not</span>. This is susceptible of two
interpretations; for there are two types of anger, a good one and an evil one. Anger is evil when,
contrary to justice, it strives inordinately for revenge. It is good when it seeks a just vindication,
namely, when the person is vexed at the time, with whom, and to the degree that, he should be. The
[above warning] is applicable to both. If it concerns evil anger, the sense is that he does not
command it but permits it. As though he said: Should it happen that anger wells up within
you&#8212;which is human enough&#8212;do not sin. You must not be led on to perform [what the inordinate
passion craves] through consenting to it. &#8220;Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is
human&#8221; (1 Cor. 10:13). For, without doubt, whoever is angered against his brother in any other way
&#8220;shall be in danger of the judgment&#8221; (Mt. 5:22). Joseph counselled his brothers against such anger:
&#8220;Be not angry in the way&#8221; (Gen. 45:24).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">If it is interpreted concerning righteous anger it is not simply permitted, like the first, but
imperative. <span style="font-weight: bold">Be angry</span> against your sins, for man desires a twofold vindication. One regarding
himself when he sins, so that penance becomes a certain type of vindication which man inflicts and
receives in himself. Such a wrath is good, and with respect to it the imperative is used: <span style="font-weight: bold">be angry</span>
against your sins, and <span style="font-weight: bold">sin not </span>any more, nor commit those types of sin with which you must again
be exasperated.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Now, some are doubtless of the opinion that a man can be mad at himself for his own sins safely,
but that this does not hold true concerning his neighbors and their sins. This is false; a man can be
mad at himself for his own sins, and at his fellow man because of his sins. Therefore, zealously be
angry at other people&#8217;s offenses. &#8220;Phinees hath turned away my wrath from the children of Israel
because he was moved with my zeal against them&#8221; (Num. 25:11). And Elias said: &#8216;With zeal have
I been zealous for the Lord God of Hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thy covenant&#8221;
(3 Kg. 19:10). By following the dictates of reason, rather than acting before [reason has had time
to reflect], you <span style="font-weight: bold">sin not. </span>&#8220;Let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger&#8221; (Jas.
1:19).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In <span style="font-weight: bold">Let not the sun go down upon your anger</span> he explains what he had said, and the explanation
can be interpreted according to the three above expositions. If it concerns evil anger, then he would
be saying: Do not nurture seeds of wrath, cast them off before sunset; for although the first
impulses of temper are excusable, due to human frailty, it is illicit to dwell on them.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In reference to good anger, as it is directed against one&#8217;s personal sins, the sun is Christ. &#8220;Unto you
that fear my name the sun of justice shall arise&#8221; (Mal. 4:2) <span style="font-weight: bold">Let not it go down upon your anger</span>,
that is, on your sins, on account of which you must be angered again and punish yourselves. When
the sins of others are in question the sun refers to reason. &#8220;Remember thy Creator in the days of
thy youth, before the time of affliction come, and the years draw nigh of which thou shalt say: They
please me not; before the sun... is darkened&#8221; (Eccl. 12:1). The sun should not set on your anger,
that is, the dictates of reason must not be clouded over. &#8220;Anger indeed killeth the foolish&#8221; (Job
5:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">The reason for the warning is indicated in <span style="font-weight: bold">Give not place to the devil. </span>The devil gains entrance
to us either through sin or consent to it. &#8220;The devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot,
the son of Simon, to betray him&#8221; (Jn. 13:2), after which it says: &#8220;After the morsel, Satan entered
into him&#8221; (<i>ibid. </i>27). Passions of this kind easily pull one&#8217;s consent [toward their desires],
especially when they have biased the judgment of reason. Anger particularly does this since it
involves the rapid, raising of blood, the speed of whose movement precedes any rational judgment.
Excited like this, the devil wins a foothold within us; thus he says <span style="font-weight: bold">give not place to the devil. </span>You
ought not to persist, he seems to say, in your ill temper, for you will only invite the demon who is
himself continually angered. God is &#8220;my deliverer from my infuriated enemies&#8221; (Ps. 17:48 *). &#8220;The
devil is come down unto you, having great wrath&#8221; (Apoc. 12:12). He cannot accomplish this, at
least in the soul of a just man. But this justice is forfeited through anger: &#8220;For the anger of man
worketh not the justice of God&#8221; (Jas. 1:20). If you do not want to give Satan a place, at least in your
soul, do not let the sun set on your wrath. &#8220;Remove anger from thy heart&#8221; (Eccl. 11:10).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Having banned the age old corruption in man&#8217;s rational and irascible powers (4:25), here he
proscribes it in regard to the concupiscible emotions when they desire temporal goods inordinately.
Concerning this he does two things:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in">First, he prohibits the old ways of these emotions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he exhorts the Ephesians to renew them (4:28b).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Stealing pertains to the concupiscible appetite&#8217;s old ways; it arises from a corrupted and inordinate
desire for a temporal object. Therefore he says <span style="font-weight: bold">He that stole, let him now steal no more, </span>as if to
say: Whoever has old and corrupted concupiscible emotions due to a contaminating desire for
transitory goods, let him not steal any more if he wants to renew them. For &#8220;confusion is upon a
thief&#8221; (Ecclus. 5:17), so that Exodus 20 (15) asserts: &#8220;Thou shalt not steal.&#8221;</p>

 he says <span style="font-weight: bold">rather let him labor,
working with his hands. </span>The Apostle himself practiced this: &#8220;For such things as were needful for
me and them that are with me, these hands have furnished&#8221; (Ac. 20:34). &#8220;For you yourselves know
how you ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you; neither did we eat any man&#8217;s
bread for nothing, but in labor and in toil we worked night and day, lest we should be chargeable
to any of you&#8221; (2 Thess. 3:7-8).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Notice that three motives for manual labor are given. Primarily, it is to obtain necessary food: &#8220;In
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread&#8221; (Gen. 3:19). Therefore, anyone who does not lawfully
have the where-with-all to live is bound to work with his hands. &#8220;If any man will not work, neither
let him eat,&#8221; (2 Thess. 3:10) seems to affirm: just as he who does not eat when necessity demands
it sins, so likewise he who does not work when necessary. This is put here to exclude stealing.
Sometimes, however, work is urged in order to dispel idleness since &#8220;Idleness hath taught much
evil&#8221; (Ecclus. 33:29). Hence, those who lead an idle life are bound to work with their hands: &#8220;For
we have heard there are some among you who walk disorderly; working not at all, but curiously
meddling. Now we charge them that are such and beseech them by the Lord Jesus Christ that,
working with silence, they would eat their own bread&#8221; (2 Thess. 3:11-12). At other times work is
recommended to discipline and control the flesh. In this sense it is included among the acts of
continence, as in 2 Corinthians 6 (5): &#8220;In labours, in watchings, in fastings.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Three reasons exist, therefore, for engaging in physical labor. The first is necessary for everyone,
and is so by a necessity of precept,

 while idleness can be avoided in other ways and the immoral
tendencies of the flesh can be controlled and checked by other means. It is sufficient if these latter
are accomplished in some way.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in"><span style="font-weight: bold">Which is good </span>follows and can be understood in two ways. If it has the accusative force it could
be rendered: Rather let him labor by the work of his hands, not at what is unlawful, but at whatever
is honest. &#8220;And in doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap, not failing&#8221; (Gal. 6:9).
&#8220;Cease to do perversely. Learn to do well&#8221; (Is. 1:16-17). Or it can be taken with a nominative force:
Rather let him labor by the work of his hands which is good. This is the reason why they should
work, as though he said: Not only is it necessary to work, it is even good to work that he who does
can live and <span style="font-weight: bold">that he may have something to give to him that suffereth need. </span>&#8220;Lend to thy
neighbour in the time of his need&#8221; (Ecclus. 29:2).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">When he states <span style="font-weight: bold">Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth </span>(v. 29) he begins to discuss what
the old man does in relation to other men. He makes two points:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in">First, be prohibits the old and encourages the new.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he provides an example for imitation at the beginning of Chapter Five (5:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">A person may be wrongly disposed toward his neighbor in two ways. In one way, he may hurt him
through evil words; in another, he may harm him through bad example. First he forbids the former,
secondly the latter (4:30). The first of these also has two sections:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in">First, he bans the old.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.295833in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Secondly, he urges them toward the new (4:29b)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Thus he says <span style="font-weight: bold">Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth. </span>A word from the mouth exteriorizes
or expresses whatever is on the mind since spoken words are signs of what occurs in the soul. A
good word is one which indicates good interior dispositions, while an evil word externalizes evil
dispositions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Man should possess a threefold inner relationship; namely, to himself, that all his powers are
subject to reason; to God, so that his reason submits to him; and to his fellow man when he loves
him as himself. Hence a word is evil when it shows that a man is not properly related within
himself. This is the false word by which he means one thing and says another; futile and vain talk
also belong to this category. Again, there are wicked words which indicate that a man is not related
properly to God, such as perjury, blasphemy and the like. Finally, there is also evil talk which is
against one&#8217;s neighbor, such as injurious, deceitful, and fraudulent words. Therefore does he say
<span style="font-weight: bold">Let no evil speech proceed from your mouth. </span>&#8220;No&#8221; is equivalent to &#8220;none.&#8221; &#8220;Keep yourselves
therefore from murmuring which profiteth nothing, and refrain your tongue from detraction: for
an obscure speech shall not go for nought&#8221; (Wis. 1:11). For God will certainly not forget any
thought, &#8220;and no word can hide itself from him&#8221; as Ecclesiasticus 42 (20) remarks. &#8220;But now put
away also any anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, or filthy speech out of your mouth&#8221; (Col.
3:8* ).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">With <span style="font-weight: bold">that which is good </span>he encourages them on toward newness because a good word, spoken at
the right time and place, is blessed. &#8220;A word in due time is best&#8221; (Prov. 15:23). &#8220;If any man speak,
let him speak as the words of God&#8221; (1 Pet. 4:11). And what for? He adds <span style="font-weight: bold">to the edification of faith
</span>in order, that is, for faith to be strengthened in the hearts of the weak: &#8220;Let all things be done to
edification&#8221; (1 Cor. 14:26).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">If it may administer grace to the hearers such a word is proven good and it is profitable. For
frequently a man repents and is disposed for grace from hearing a good sermon and through the
power it conveys. &#8220;While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that
heard the word&#8221; (Ac. 10:44). Our Lord spoke in this fashion; Luke 4 (22) recounts: &#8220;They
wondered at the words of grace that proceeded from his mouth.&#8221; &#8220;The words of the mouth of a
wise man are grace&#8221; (Eccl. 10:12).</p>

the similarity of what he does [to the results of human anger], so he could also be said to be
grieved. When some person is saddened he withdraws from whoever is depressing him, likewise
does the Holy Spirit withdraw from one who is sinning. Thus the meaning of <span style="font-weight: bold">grieve not the Holy
Spirit </span>is: do not chase him away or reject him through sin. &#8220;For the Holy Spirit of discipline will
flee from the deceitful, and will withdraw himself from thoughts that are without understanding:
and he shall not abide when iniquity cometh in&#8221; (Wis. 1:5).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Therefore, the Holy Spirit must not be saddened, and this on account of the blessing of his saving
seal. Thus he adds whereby you are sealed, that is, you are reformed and set apart from others.
Whoever possesses this seal shall enjoy eternal life. For this reason he must be held on to and in
no way grieved since without him there is no life everlasting. &#8220;God also hath sealed us and given
the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts&#8221; (2 Cor. 1:22). Men did this happen? In the day of redemption,
that is, of baptism. &#8220;Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into
the kingdom of God&#8221; (Jn. 3:5). &#8220;You shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence&#8221;
(Ac. 1:5). He says redemption since in baptism a man becomes a sharer in the redemption
accomplished by Christ.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In what follows (v. 31) he discloses what specifically belongs to the old man. For at times a man
will sadden his friend out of anger, at other times on set purpose. Anger, however, has three
degrees. Sometimes it is constrained and remains within the heart, as when someone is only
inwardly mad. On other occasions it is expressed verbally, although not in a contemptuous way,
as when someone says &#8220;Raca&#8221; (cf. Mt. 5:22). At still another time contempt may be present in the
verbal expression as in &#8220;You cursed fool!&#8221; Hence he first writes down what pertains to anger of
the heart; second what is proper to its inordinate expression; and third what has reference to
contempt.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">In anger of the heart the following succeed one another. Firstly, anger is the result of sorrow,

which Sacred Scripture refers to as bitterness: &#8220;As Anna had her heart full of bitterness, she prayed
to the Lord, shedding many tears&#8221; (1 Kg. 1:10*). Thus he says <span style="font-weight: bold">all bitterness</span> which arises from the
memory of past injuries. For &#8220;there is no understanding where there is bitterness&#8221; (Ecclus. 21:15).
Secondly, it immediately desires revenge; hence he says <span style="font-weight: bold">and anger</span> which is a craving for revenge.
&#8220;For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God&#8221; (Jas. 1:20). Thirdly, an angered person
imagines whatever offends him is an insult, and he is indignant if it passes without punishment.
Therefore, <span style="font-weight: bold">and indignation</span> follows.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Noise has to do with the inordinate expression of anger. &#8220;And I looked that he should do judgment,
and behold, iniquity: and do justice, and behold, a cry&#8221; (Is. 5:7). Hence he says <span style="font-weight: bold">and clamour</span>. In
a similar way, blasphemy is either against God or against his saints. Yet &#8220;he that blasphemeth the
name of the Lord, dying let him die&#8221; (Lev. 24:16). Thus he says <span style="font-weight: bold">and blasphemy</span>. And he adds that
these <span style="font-weight: bold">be put away from you, with all malice </span>of action. Reject &#8220;all malice and all guile and
dissimulations&#8221; (1 Pet. 2:1).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 0.0366667in; margin-right: -0.1625in; margin-bottom: 0.125in">Next, when he says <span style="font-weight: bold">be ye kind one to another </span>he determines what pertains to the new man which
is contrary to the above mentioned passions. Opposed to bitterness is kindness; so he says <span style="font-weight: bold">be ye
kind one to another</span> since &#8220;the spirit of wisdom is benevolent&#8221; (Wis. 1:6).  Mercy is contrary to
anger, thus he mentions <span style="font-weight: bold">merciful:</span> &#8220;Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful&#8221; (Lk.
6:36).  Opposed to indignation is a pardoning attitude; whence he says <span style="font-weight: bold">forgiving one another even
as God hath forgiven you in Christ</span>. &#8220;Forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against
another. Even as he Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also&#8221; (Col. 3:13). &#8220;He that spared not even
his own Son,&#8221; and shortly afterwards, &#8220;how hath he not alos, with him, given us all things?&#8221; (Rom.
8:32).</p>
