<p>Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and our brother Timothy, to Philemon, our beloved and
fellow worker, and to Appia, the sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the
church that is in your house: grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I give thanks to my God, always making remembrance of you in my prayers, as I hear of your
charity and of the faith that you have in our Lord Jesus and towards all the saints. May the
sharing of your faith be made evident in full knowledge of all the good that is in you, in
Christ Jesus. For I had great joy and consolation in your charity, because through you,
brother, the hearts of the saints have found rest.</p>
<p>For this reason, though I am very confident that I might charge you in Christ Jesus to do, what
is fitting, yet for the sake of charity I prefer to plead, since you are such as you are; as Paul, an
old man &#8212; and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ &#8212; I plead with you for my own son,
whom I have begotten in prison, for Onesimus. He once was useless to you, but now is useful
both to me and to you. I am sending him back to you, and do you welcome him as though he
were my very heart. I had wanted to keep him here with me that in your stead he might wait
on me in my imprisonment for the Gospel; but I did not want to do anything without your
counsel, in order that your kindness might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.</p>
<p>Perhaps, indeed, he departed from you for a short while so that you might receive him for
ever, no longer as a slave, but instead of a slave as a brother most dear, especially to me, and
how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord! If therefore you does count me as a
partner, welcome him as you would me. And if he did you any injury or owes anything,
charge it to me. I, Paul, write it with my own hand: I will repay it &#8212; not to say to you that you
owe me your very self. Yes, indeed, brother! May I too make use of you in the Lord! Console
my heart in the Lord!</p>
<p>Trusting in your compliance, I am writing to you, knowing that you wilt do even beyond what
I say. At the same time make ready a lodging for me too, for I hope that through your prayers
I shall be restored to you. Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, Mark, Aristarchus,
Demas and Luke, my fellow workers send you greetings. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Preface</span></p>
<p>&#8216;If you have a faithful servant, let him be to you as your own soul&#8217; (Sirach 33:31). The wise
man shows three things concerning master and slave, namely, what is required on the side of
the servant; what ought to be the feeling of the master towards the servant; and what is the
use of the servant. From the servant fidelity is asked, for in this he is a good servant, because
what he is and all that he has he ought to give to the master. Matthew 24-45: &#8216;Who, do you
think, is the faithful and prudent servant...&#8217; And he says, &#8216;if he is faithful&#8217;, because fidelity is
found in few. Proverbs 20:6: &#8216;But who shall find a faithful man?&#8217; The master ought to feel
towards his servant as a friend, hence it is said, &#8216;as his own soul&#8217;. For this is proper to friends,
that they are of one mind in what they will and what they do not will. Acts 4.32: &#8216;Now the
multitude of the believers were of one heart and one soul.&#8217; By which we are given to
understand that there is a consensus of master and servant, when the faithful servant becomes
a friend. As for his use, he should be treated like a brother, for he is a brother, both with
respect to generation of nature, because they have the same author &#8212;Job 31.13: &#8216;If I have
despised to abide judgement with my man-servant&#8217;; Malachi 2:10: &#8216;Have we not all one
father? Did not one God created us?&#8217; &#8212;and with respect to the generation of grace, which is
the same for both. Galatians 3:27: &#8216;For all you who have been baptized into Christ, have put
on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither slave nor freeman; there is neither
male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.&#8217; Matthew 23:8: &#8216;And all you are
brothers.&#8217; These words are relevant to the matter of this epistle. For as it was shown above
how spiritual prelates should relate to their subjects, so here he shows how temporal masters
should relate to their temporal servants, and how the faithful servant to his master.</p>
<p>The occasion of the epistle is this. At Colossae an important Christian had a servant who
secretly fled to Rome where he was baptized by the Apostle who now writes on his behalf.
First he gives a greeting, followed by the narrative of the epistle. In the greeting he mentions
persons who send their greeting and then the recipients and finally the good hoped for.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">On the text</span></p>
<p>Therefore he says <i>Paul</i>, &#8212; a name to be revered by all the faithful who have been taught by
him &#8212; <i>a prisoner</i>. 2 Timothy 2:9: &#8216;in which I suffer even to bonds, as a criminal&#8217;. For now
he is a prisoner in Rome, but of Christ Jesus, to give the reason for his chains. For it is highly
praiseworthy to be imprisoned for the sake of Christ; for in this he is blessed. Matthew 5:10:
&#8216;Blessed are they who suffer persecution for justice&#8217; sake...&#8217; 2 Peter 4:15: &#8216;Let none of you
suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a slanderer, or as one coveting what belongs to others. But
if he suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God under this name.&#8217;
Acts 5.41: &#8216;So they departed from the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had been counted worthy
to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus.&#8217;</p>
<p><i>And our brother Timothy</i>... They are brothers with regard to perfect faith. Philippians 2:20:
&#8216;For I have no one so like-minded who is so genuinely solicitous for you.&#8217; He joins Timothy
to himself, that he might more easily succeed, because it is impossible that the prayers of
many will not be heard.</p>
<p>Then he mentions the persons greeted. And first the principal person greeted, then others,
particularly the husband and wife whose house it is, to whom the servant is obliged. <i>To
Philemon, our beloved and fellow worker, and to Appia, beloved sister</i>... Beloved, he says on
account of her good works. John 13:34: &#8216;This is my command, that you love one another.&#8217;
Fellow worker, because he ministers to the saints. Proverbs 18.19: &#8216;A brother that is helped
by his brother is like a strong city.&#8217; Then he mentions <i>Archippus our fellow soldier</i>, who was
so powerful at Colossae that all Christians were under his protection.</p>
<p>That is why he brings in the whole Church there, of which he was the bishop, writing in
Colossians 4:17, &#8216;And say to Archippus: &#8220;Look to the ministry which you have received in
the Lord, that you fulfil it.&#8221;&#8217; And he calls Archippus &#8216;fellow soldier&#8217; because all prelates are,
as it were, spiritual soldiers of the Church. 2 Corinthians 10:4: &#8216;For the weapons of our
warfare are not carnal...&#8217; <i>And to the church</i>... He adds this in order to move him to hear
plainly the expected good that is set forth, as was customary. Then when he says, <i>I give
thanks to my God</i>, the burden of the letter begins. First, he gives thanks; then he makes his
plea, <i>For this reason</i>... ; finally, he concludes, <i>For I had great joy</i>...</p>
<p>Again, first he expresses thanks; second he gives the reason for his gratitude: <i>as I hear of
your charity</i>... ; third, the reason why he thanks God: <i>For I had great joy and consolation... I
give thanks to my God</i>. Colossians 3:15: &#8216;Show yourself thankful.&#8217; Philippians 4.6: &#8216;With
thanksgiving let your petitions be made to God.&#8217; As if he said: I give thanks for past things in
order that I might pray for future things. Therefore he says: <i>always making remembrance of
you in my prayers</i>... Philippians 11:7: &#8216;Because I have you in my heart, all of you, alike in my
chains.&#8217; Isaiah 49-15: &#8216;Can a woman forget her infant, so as not to have pity on the son of her
womb? And if she should forget, yet will not I forget you.&#8217;</p>
<p>Stating the matter of his giving thanks and of his prayer, he shows what he asks when he
prays for them. The matter of this was the needs and goods of Philemon, namely, both charity
and faith. For without charity nothing avails and through it all things are had. 1 Corinthians
13:1: &#8216;If I should speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have charity, I have
become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.&#8217; Again, without faith no one can love God,
because he does not truly know God. He makes no mention of hope, because it is midway
between and is understood in the others. But in whom should they have faith and charity? <i>in
our Lord Jesus</i>. 1 Corinthians 16:22: &#8216;If any man does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him
be anathema.&#8217; This is necessary, because from Christ more sweetly comes love for the
members; because he who does not love the members, does not love the head. 1 John 4.20:
&#8216;For how can he who does not love his brother, whom he sees, love God, whom he does not
see?&#8217;</p>
<p><i>And towards all the saints</i>... Faith is based on doctrine insofar as it is manifested through
Christ, &#8216;because no one has seen God&#8217;, John 31.18; and, &#8216;You believe in God, believe also in
me,&#8217; John 14.1. We have Christ, therefore, through faith. <i>Towards all the saints</i> can be
understood in two ways. In one way, because from the faith they have in Christ proceed the
prayers made for the saints. Or, faith consists principally in the divinity as it is announced by
Christ, and not only by Christ, but also by the saints. Matthew 28:19: &#8216;Go therefore and make
disciples of all nations...&#8217; Therefore we ought to believe not only what was said by Christ but
also what was said by the saints. Hebrews 2:3: &#8216;For it was first announced by the Lord and
was confirmed unto us by those who heard him.&#8217;</p>
<p><i>May the sharing of your faith</i>... This is shared in two ways. In one way, that it might be a
sign. <i>Be made evident in full knowledge</i>... That is, so great is your charity, that the sharing of
your faith... <i>I give thanks... always making remembrance</i>... That he might show what he seeks
for him in praying. And the sharing of the faith can be understood in two ways. Either
because in faith they share with all the saints, not having any new faith, like heretics. 1
Corinthians 1:10: &#8216;That you all say the same thing.&#8217; Or, sharing, whereby you share good
things with the saints, proceeding from faith. 1 Timothy 6.17: &#8216;Charge the rich of this world
not to be proud, or to trust in the uncertainty of riches, but in God, who provides all things in
abundance for our enjoyment.&#8217;</p>
<p><i>Made evident in full knowledge</i>... That is, that the good hidden in the heart become evident in
good works. <i>In full knowledge of all the good that is in you... And this in Christ Jesus</i>. James
2.18: &#8216;Show me your faith without works, and I from my works will show you my faith.&#8217; Or,
there are in the world many works which are good for men, and yet are not good for God,
because they do not come about rightly. Proverbs 14:12: &#8216;There is a way which seems just to
a man: but in the end it leads to death.&#8217; Ecclesiastes 8:10: &#8216;I saw the wicked buried: who also
when they were yet living were in the holy place, and were praised in the city as men of just
works.&#8217; But this is manifested through correct faith, when reward comes from God, who only
rewards the righteous. Therefore he says <i>made evident in full knowledge</i>, that is, that this
might be made evident, that you might know every good. Or that <i>all the good that is in you</i>
might become known, which is the fruit of divinity. Exodus 33.19: &#8216;I will show you all good.&#8217;
Wisdom 7:11: &#8216;Now all good things come to me together with her.&#8217;</p>
<p>The reason he gives thanks is joy. And he says, <i>For I had great joy and consolation</i>... 3 John
4: &#8216;I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.&#8217; For this joy
alleviates anxiety. That is why he adds consolation. Psalm 93:119: &#8216;When anxieties are
increased in my heart, your comfortings delight my soul.&#8217; He explains why, saying <i>because
through you, brother, the hearts of the saints have found rest</i>. Colossians 3:12... &#8216;Put on,
therefore, as God&#8217;s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of mercy, kindness, humility,
meekness, patience.&#8217; 3 John 2: &#8216;Beloved I pray that in all things you may prosper and be in
health...&#8217;</p>
<p>Then when he says <i>For this reason</i>, he makes his plea. And first he states the confidence with
which he asks; second, the petition itself, <i>I plead with you</i>...; third, his reason, <i>Perhaps,
indeed</i>... He says, For this reason, that is, because you so abound in charity, I have great trust
in Christ Jesus, as if to say, not from me, but from the authority of Jesus Christ, in which faith
I gave birth to you. Therefore, I could command you as a father both concerning your own
and common matters. Otherwise a prelate would not have had the power to command what
was for his usefulness, or the Church&#8217;s, or of the good morals of the Christian religion. <i>Yet
for the sake of charity I prefer to plead</i>... Proverbs 18.23: &#8216;The poor will speak with
supplications...&#8217; And why? <i>Since you are such as you are</i>.</p>
<p>There are two things on account of which one ought to plead. Because of old age. 1 Timothy
1: &#8216;Do not reproach an old man, but ask him as a father.&#8217; Again, because of the
honourableness of virtue, for where we are not deficient, we are equals. Sirach 32:1, &#8216;Have
they made you ruler? Be not lifted up: be among them as one of them.&#8217; Therefore he says,
<i>since you are such as you are</i>, as Paul, <i>an old man</i>, as if to say, if you were a boy, I would
demand this of you, but you too are old. You are of the same stage of life as I. Not that they
are such and so much simply speaking, but in a way similar, which he says out of his
humility. Romans 12:10: &#8216;anticipating one another with honour&#8217;. Origen said that it is rare to
find a useful teacher in the Church who is not old, thinking of Peter and Paul.</p>
<p>Having expressed his confidence in Philemon&#8217;s goodness, here he states his request. And first
he indicates the person on whose behalf he pleads; second, he concludes the request. The first
is subdivided into two, because first by describing the person he shows that he has received
him in spiritual birth; second, by a change of status. Therefore he says, <i>I plead with you for
my own son, whom I have begotten in prison, for Onesimus</i>, who is his present concern. And
acquiring a son in default of time, he loves him more, as an old man loves sons born to him in
his old age. Genesis 37:3: &#8216;Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in
his old age.&#8217; This one [Onesimus] was given birth in chains. Second, there is the change in
status. For if he had persevered in sin, he would not be worthy of leniency. Note that Paul
says little and means much. For as Cicero taught, one ought to make little of one&#8217;s own deed
as much as possible. Thus the Apostle speaks lightly of his offence, saying, <i>He once was
useless to you</i>, that is, harmful in taking away your possession, but now, converted from evil
to the state of virtue, he is useful for the service of God and man. 2 Timothy 2:21: &#8216;If anyone,
therefore, has cleansed himself from these, he will be a vessel for honourable use...&#8217; Proverbs
25:4: &#8216;Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most pure vessel.&#8217;</p>
<p>Then when he says, <i>I am sending him back to you</i>, he makes his request. First, he makes it,
then he answers a question: <i>I had wanted to keep him here.</i> And so he says, <i>and do you
welcome him as though he were my very heart.</i> And this because I have seen him changed,
the sign of which is, I send him back to you. On the contrary, Deuteronomy 23.15: &#8216;Thou
shalt not deliver to his master the servant that is fled to you.&#8217; I reply that is true when the
master seeks him in order to put him to death. Therefore, he says, I did not want to do
anything...&#8217; Philippians 1-7: &#8216;I have the right to feel so about you, because I have you in my
heart, all of you, alike in my chains.&#8217;</p>
<p>And he responds to a question, because it might be said if he is useful to you, why do you not
keep him unto death? And he gives the reason for sending him back. First, he considers why
he might keep him; second, why he rejects that idea: <i>but I did not want to do anything without
your counsel.</i> Therefore, he says to Philemon who, although he is a great man, is accustomed
to minister to the Apostle. Matthew 10:26: &#8216;On the contrary, whoever wishes to become great
among you shall be your servant.&#8217; Out of this confidence he proposed to keep him, so that in
place of Philemon he might minister to him. <i>I had wanted to keep him here with me that in
your stead he might wait on me in my imprisonment for the Gospel.</i> This was something
especially needed since he was in chains for the sake of Christ, for one is provided for when
he suffers for his master. The reason he rejected the idea was that he did not want to use
another&#8217;s property without the owner&#8217;s knowledge. Hence, <i>but I did not want to do
anything</i>... As if he said: if I should keep him, it would please you who do not wish to resist
but it would be a kind of force. But I did not want that, indeed I wanted it to come about
voluntarily. Exodus 25.2: &#8216;Of every man who offers of his own accord, you shall take them,&#8217;
that is, the first fruits. 2 Corinthians 9:7: &#8216;Let each one give according as he has determined in
his heart, not grudgingly or from compulsion, for &#8220;God loves a cheerful giver.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p>Then when he says, <i>Perhaps, indeed</i>..., he gives the reason why he ought to receive him
kindly, first, on the side of God, second, on the side of the Apostle: <i>If therefore you count me
as a partner</i>... ; third, on the part of Philemon himself: <i>Trusting in your compliance</i>... On the
side of God, because the providence of God often permits what is evil to come about, in order
that good might follow from it, as is clear from the sale of Joseph, that he might free Egypt
and the family of his father. Genesis 45-5: &#8216;For God sent me before you into Egypt for your
preservation.&#8217; He says Perhaps because the judgements of God are incomprehensible,
Romans 11:33. And he says <i>instead of a slave</i>, that is, in place of a slave. Matthew 23.8: &#8216;For
one is your master and all are your brothers.&#8217; And not only yours, but mine in comparison to
God, though he is a son to the ministry.</p>
<p><i>How much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</i> This can be expounded in two
ways. First, as referring to the first origin of the divine creation, and thus he is a brother.
Deuteronomy 32:6: &#8216;Is not he your father, that hath possessed you, and made you, and created
you?&#8217; Malachi 2:10: &#8216;Have we not all one father? Did not one God created us?&#8217; Again, by
trust in God. Or it might rather be for the good of Philemon, because he is close to him in the
flesh, since that is how he is his slave, because whatever he is bodily belongs to Philemon.
Hence one is moved by charity for two reasons, by love which has its origin in the flesh, or by
spiritual love. On the part of the Apostle, he first declares his friendship, under which aegis
he wants Philemon to take Onesimus back; second, he offers to pay any damages; third he
shows the function of receiving. Second, <i>If, therefore, you</i>... Third, <i>Yes, indeed, brother!</i></p>
<p>Therefore, he says, If, therefore, you dost count me as a partner, welcome him. 1 John 1:7:
&#8216;But if we walk in the light as he also is in the light, we have fellowship with one
another.&#8217;And he says <i>as you would me</i> because he is linked with me. Matthew 10:40: &#8216;Who
receives you, receives me.&#8217;</p>
<p>Second, he offers to make good any injury to Philemon, saying, <i>And if he did you any injury
or owes you anything</i>, namely by leaving his service, <i>charge it to me</i>. As if to say, I will make
satisfaction. Galatians 6.2.: &#8216;Bear one another&#8217;s burdens.&#8217; And more, because he first offers to
make it good; second, he shows that Philemon is in his debt, not of necessity but of will.</p>
<p>Therefore he says, <i>I, Paul</i>, as if to say, that you might be certain of restitution. <i>I write it with
my own hand.</i> And this not out of necessity, <i>because you owe me your very self</i>, because I
snatched you from eternal death, and thus he should do this for his liberator. Tobias 9:2: &#8216;If I
should give myself to be your servant, I should not make a worthy return for your care.&#8217; And
he adds, <i>Yes, indeed, brother, may I too make use of you</i>, as if to say, if you want me for a
partner, take him back, and I will so use you, brother, that is, if you do it, you will fill my
wishes with joy. For to make use is to use the fruit and thus it is to use for the useful, as I
enjoy fruit. It implies the sweetness of the fruit; Song of Songs 2:3: &#8216;And his fruit was sweet
to my palate.&#8217; And the end, because the ultimate produce of the tree is its fruit. Therefore, to
enjoy is properly to have something which is pleasant and final. Hence Augustine says that
we enjoy thinking of things in which the will delights because of their sweetness. Again, to
enjoy is to adhere to something for its own sake. Sometimes &#8216;enjoy&#8217; and ,use&#8217; are taken
commonly as implying enjoyment without the contrary. Sirach 8:10: &#8216;and to serve great men
without blame&#8217;. Therefore he says, <i>May I too make use of you</i>, because you are against me in
nothing. And if in this you please me, there will be nothing in my heart concerning you that
saddens me, and thus you will delight me. But if we take enjoyment as something final, then
one does not enjoy man, but God alone. Contrary to this seems to be Wisdom 2:6: &#8216;Come
therefore, and let us enjoy the good things that are present: and let us speedily use the
creatures as in youth.&#8217; Hence he adds <i>in the Lord</i>, that is, May I, too, make use of you in the
delight of God, rejoicing in the divine good that is in you, because his action is love, and the
enjoyment of its effect, namely, charity. That is why he adds <i>console my heart</i>. A man is
consoled spiritually when the desires of his heart are fulfilled. As if he said: fulfil the deepest
desires of my heart. And not with respect to evil, but in the Lord, and thus the fulfilment of
desire is good.</p>
<p>Then when he says <i>Trusting in your compliance</i>, he provides a reason on the side of
Philemon, and a commendation of his obedience. First he shows how he is confident in his
obeying; second he adds to it something similar. Therefore he says, <i>Trusting in your
compliance.</i> 2 Corinthians 7:16: &#8216;I rejoice that in all things I can have confidence in you.&#8217; 1
Sam 15:22: &#8216;For obedience is better than sacrifices.&#8217; But he writes more cautiously because a
man listens more closely to one he expects to see again than if he despairs. Therefore he says,
<i>At the same time make ready a lodging for me too.</i> For it was his custom when he was in
Colossae to stay in his home. Chrysostom asks what we are to make of this remark in which a
poor man commands a rich man by letter from across the expanse of the earth to prepare a
lodging for him. What would have to be prepared for one content with bread and cheap
victuals? It should be said that it was not for the sake of the preparation of lodging that he
says this, but to insinuate familiarity and love; in this way he will be prompt to obey. The
Apostle therefore does not say this on account of external trappings but out of his devotion.
<i>For I hope that through your prayers I shall be restored to you.</i></p>
<p>Against this is the fact that he never returned to them but died in Rome, therefore his hope
was dashed. I reply that the hope of the just is of two kinds, the chief of which is for his own
good, and this is never dashed; another secondary hope is the proof of others, and this is
sometimes dashed, because their merits are contrary, as the just man is sometimes not heeded
by others. But was he deceived in his trust? It should be said that God alone knows the future;
that is not for human knowledge, except the prophetic. And no prophet knows all the future
events that concern himself. Only Christ did, because he did not have the Holy Spirit in a
limited way. Thus Isaac the great prophet was deceived in Jacob. So it is not to be wondered
at in an apostle if he does not know.</p>
<p>Then he ends his letter with a greeting, and first on the part of others, second on his own. He
says, they send you greetings, and we read of them at the end of Colossians. But this can be
doubted since he mentions Demas. How can this be, since he said in 2. Timothy 3:8, &#8216;For
Demas has deserted me, loving this world&#8217;? How, then, can he use his name?</p>
<p>It might be said that he returned to him, but this does not seem to be the case, because this
letter was written after that to Timothy and here he says, <i>I hope that through your prayers</i>,
and there he foretells his death, saying, &#8216;The time of my deliverance is at hand.&#8217; Therefore it
should be said that Paul was in Rome for nearly nine years, and this letter was written at the
beginning, whereas the second letter to Timothy was written at the end of his life and then
Demas weary of imprisonment deserted him. The letters of Paul are not arranged
chronologically, because the letters to the Corinthians were written before the letter to the
Romans, and this before the last letter to Timothy. That is placed first because of its matter,
which is worthier. His own greeting here is the same one that ends the second letter to
Timothy. Thanks be to God, amen.</p>
