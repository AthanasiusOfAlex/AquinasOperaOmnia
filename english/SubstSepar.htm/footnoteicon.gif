var WPFootnote2 = '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Palaeographically, there is little justification for this particular reading which we have\
adopted, since all 12 mss. seem to be representative of a tradition which attributes &#8220;vapor&#8221; to\
Heraclitus. Manuscripts &#8220;A&#8221; and &#8220;B&#8221;, i.e., CAMBRIDGE, <i>Corpus Christi</i>, Libr. ms. 35 and\
TOLEDO, <i>Bibl. del Cabildo</i>, 19-15 do omit <i>Hippasus</i> but still attribute both fire and &#8220;vapor&#8221;\
to Heraclitus. Manuscript &#8220;D&#8221;, i.e., VENICE, S. Marco 31, IV suppresses the phrase &#8220;ut\
Hippasus aut vaporem ut&#8221; and substitutes for it &#8220;ac&#8221; leaving, at the same time, a space\
between &#8220;ac&#8221; and &#8220;Heraclitus&#8221;. The scribe of &#8220;D&#8221; evidently deleted the troublesome phrase\
and left a space for a future correction. Since no sources of Greek philosophy credit\
Heraclitus with &#8220;vapor&#8221;, the phrase &#8220;ut Hippasus aut vaporem&#8221; seems to be an interpolation\
which, most interestingly, is not found in the 1488 Soncinas nor in the 1490 and 1498\
Pizzamanus printed editions. Hence, we have made an emendation by suppressing the\
obvious interpolation and the text reads: &#8220;Et si unum, aut aquam ut Thales Milesius, aut\
a&euml;rem ut Diogenes, aut ignem ut Heraclitus&#8221;. For the relative value of incunabula in the\
establishment of a critical text, cf. above, Introduction, pp. 13, 14 and F. Lescoe, <i>Sancti:\

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE OPINION OF THE EARLY PHILOSOPHERS AND OF PLATO</span></p>
<p>Since we cannot be present at the holy ceremonies in honor of the angels, we should not let
this time of devotion go by fruitlessly; rather, such time as we do not spend in singing their
praises, we should spend in writing about them. And because our aim is to present as best we
can the excellence of the holy angels, we ought to begin with man&#8217;s earliest conjectures about
the angels. In this way, we shall be in a position to accept whatever we find that agrees with
faith, and refute whatever is opposed to Catholic teaching.</p>
<p>2.&#8212;The first of those who philosophized on the natures of things believed that only bodies
existed and held that the first principles of things were certain corporeal elements, either one
or several.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote1', WPFootnote1 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( WPFootnote1 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote1\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 And if they held the first principle to be one, either they thought it was water, as
Thales of Miletus did, or air as Diogenes, or fire as Heraclitus.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote2', WPFootnote2 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

  {

    document.write( WPFootnote2 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote2\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 If they thought the principles
to be several, they thought them to be either finite in number, as did Empedocles, who posited
four elements and along with them, two moving principles, namely, love and strife;
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote3', WPFootnote3 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote3" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote3 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote3\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 or
infinite in number, as in the case of Democritus and Anaxagoras, both of whom posited an
infinite number of minimal parts as the principles of all things, except that Democritus held
that these parts were similar in kind, differing only in figure, order, and position.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote4', WPFootnote4 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote4" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote4 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote4\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>

Anaxagoras, on the other hand, thought that in the case of diverse things which have similar
parts, the first principles are the infinite minimal parts.</p>
<p>Moreover, since all of these philosophers had the natural conviction that they should consider
as god that which was the first principle of things, just as each of them had attributed to a
certain corporeal element the rank of a first principle, so he likewise felt that the name and
honor of divinity should be given to this element. These things were mid for this reason, that
for all of these men and their followers, it was the case that no incorporeal substances, which
we call &#8220;angels&#8221;, existed.</p>
<p>The Epicureans, however, who traced their origin to the teachings of Democritus, posited
certain corporeal gods, resembling human beings in appearance,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote5', WPFootnote5 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote5" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote5 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote5\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 whom they held completely</p>
<p>free and without any cares, so that by enjoying ceaseless pleasures, they would be blessed.
This teaching had such a far-reaching effect that it influenced even Jewish worshipers of God,
a sect of whom, the Sadducees, held that neither angels nor spirits existed.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote6', WPFootnote6 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote6" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote6 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote6\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>3.&#8212;The early philosophers, however, opposed this opinion in three ways. For although, at
first, Anaxagoras with the other Natural Philosophers posited certain material or corporeal
principles, nevertheless, he was the first among the philosophers to assert a certain
incorporeal principle, namely, an intellect.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote7', WPFootnote7 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote7" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote7 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote7\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Since indeed, according to his view, all corporeal
things were mixed in all things, it did not seem possible that corporeal bodies could have
been distinguished from one another, unless there existed some principle of distinction which
was itself completely unmixed and had nothing in common with corporeal nature.</p>
<p>But, although Anaxagoras&#8217; opinion was much closer to the truth than that of the philosophers
who posited only a corporeal nature, yet it falls short of the truth in two respects.</p>
<p>First, because it is apparent from his position that he posited only one separate intellect which
had produced this world by distinguishing what was mixed. But since we attribute the
establishment of the world to God, from this point of view, we can gather nothing from his
opinion as to the incorporeal substances, which we call angels and which axe below God and
above corporeal natures.</p>
<p>Second, because concerning the intellect, which he said to be one and unmixed, he seems to
have failed in this respect, since he did not sufficiently express its power and eminence.
Instead of defining this intellect, which he considered to be separate, as the universal
principle of being, he makes it to be only a distinguishing principle, for he did not hold that
the bodies that were mixed with one another, received being (esse) from the separate intellect;
they received from it only distinctions.</p>
<p>4.&#8212;Plato therefore proceeded by a more adequate way to refute the opinion of these early
Naturalists.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote8', WPFootnote8 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote8" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote8 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote8\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For since the early Naturalists had held that man could not know the definite
truth of things, both because of the continuous passing of corporeal things and because of the
deception of the senses by which bodies are known, Plato posited certain natures, separate
from the matter of flowing things, in which truth remained abiding.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote9', WPFootnote9 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote9" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote9 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote9\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 By adhering to these
natures, our soul knew the truth.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote10', WPFootnote10 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote10" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote10 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote10\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Hence, as the intellect in knowing truth, apprehends certain
things beyond the matter of sensible things, Plato thus believed that there existed certain
realities separate from sensible things.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote11', WPFootnote11 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote11" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote11 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote11\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Now our intellect uses a two-fold abstraction in arriving at the understanding of truth: One,
according as it grasps mathematical numbers, magnitudes, and figures without the
understanding of sensible matter; for, in understanding the number two or three, or a line, a
surface, a triangle, or a square, there is not included together with it in our apprehension
anything pertaining to what is hot or cold, or the like, which is perceptible by sense. The
intellect, however, uses another abstraction when it understands something universal without
the consideration of something particulax, as when we understand man without including in
our understanding anything about Socrates, Plato, or any other individual. The same appears
in other cases.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote12', WPFootnote12 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote12" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote12 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote12\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>5.&#8212;Plato accordingly posited two classes of beings abstracted from sensible things, namely,
mathematicals, and universals to which he gave the name of Forms or Ideas.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote13', WPFootnote13 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote13" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote13 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote13\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 There
appeared, however, to be this difference between them, namely, that in the case of
mathematicals, we can grasp several members of one species, for example, two equal lines or
two identical equilateral triangles; whereas with Forms, this is absolutely impossible; man,
for example, taken universally is only one in Form.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote14', WPFootnote14 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote14" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote14 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote14\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 And so, Plato posited mathematicals
between Forms or Ideas and sensible things; since mathematicals agree with sensible things in
that many are contained in the same species, and they agree with the Forms in that they are
separate from sensible matter.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote15', WPFootnote15 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote15" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote15 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote15\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Further, among Forms themselves, he posited a certain order,
on the ground that according as something was simpler in the intellect, so fax was it prior
within the order of things. Now that which is first in the intellect is the one and the good; for
he understands nothing who does not understand something one, and the one and the good
follow upon one another. Hence Plato held that the first Idea of the One, which he called the
One-in-itself and the Goodin-itself, was the first principle of things and this Idea he said was
the highest good.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote16', WPFootnote16 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote16" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote16 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote16\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Under this One, he established among the substances separate from
matter
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote17', WPFootnote17 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote17" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote17 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote17\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 diverse orders of participating and participated beings, all of which orders he called
secondary gods,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote18', WPFootnote18 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote18" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote18 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote18\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 as being certain unities below the first simple unity.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote19', WPFootnote19 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote19" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote19 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote19\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>6.&#8212;Again, inasmuch as all Forms participate in the One, the intellect likewise must participate
in the Forms of things in order to have understanding.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote20', WPFootnote20 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote20" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote20 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote20\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Therefore, just as under the highest
God, who is the prime unity, simple and unparticipated, other Forms of things exist as
secondary unities and gods; so, under the order of these Forms or unities, he posited an order
of separate intellects, which participate in the above-mentioned Forms in order to have actual
understanding.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote21', WPFootnote21 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote21" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote21 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote21\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Among these intellects, an intellect is higher according as it is nearer to the first intellect
which has full participation in the Forms; just as among the gods or unities, that one is higher
which shares more perfectly in the first unity.</p>
<p>Although Plato distinguished between the gods and the intellects, he did not mean to imply
that the gods could not have understanding. It was his desire, rather, that they should
understand in a supra-intellectual manner; that is, instead of understanding by participating in
certain Forms, they should have understanding through themselves, with the proviso that
every one of them was good and one only through participating in the first One and Good.
Again, because we see that certain souls possess understanding which, however, does not
befit a soul by the fact that it is a soul, otherwise it would follow that every soul is an intellect
and that it would he intelligent in its whole nature, he further posited that under the order of
the separate intellects, there was an order of souls, the nobler of which participate in
intellectual power, while the lowest of them are lacking in it.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote22', WPFootnote22 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote22" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote22 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote22\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Again, because bodies do not
seem to be capable of moving themselves unless they have a soul, Plato held that self-motion
belongs to bodies insofar as they participate in soul, since those bodies lacking in this
participation, are not moved, unless they are moved by another. Whence he considered it to
be an essential property of souls that they move themselves.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote23', WPFootnote23 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote23" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote23 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote23\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>7.&#8212;In this way, below the order of souls, Plato posited the order of bodies, but in such a
manner that the highest of the bodies, namely, the first heavens, which is moved by its own
motion, receives motion from the highest soul, and so on to the very lowest of the heavenly
bodies. Below these, furthermore, the Platonists placed immortal bodies, namely, a&euml;real or
ethereal bodies, which participate eternally in soul. Some of these they considered to be
altogether independent of earthly bodies and these they said to be bodies of demons; others
became entombed in earthly bodies, which is the case with human souls.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote24', WPFootnote24 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote24" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote24 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote24\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For they did not
believe that this earthly human body which we touch and see, participates immediately in the
soul; rather, there is another nobler body belonging to the soul, incorruptible and everlasting,
even ass the soul itself is incorruptible
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote25', WPFootnote25 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote25\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 in such wise that the soul with its everlasting and
invisible body is in this grosser body not as a form in matter but as a sailor in a ship.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote26', WPFootnote26 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote26\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 And
just as they said that some men were good and others wicked, so too, with the demons. But
the heavenly souls, the separate intellects and all the gods, they said were all good.

<p>In this way, therefore, between us and the highest God, it is clear that they posited four orders,
namely, that of the secondary gods, that of the separate intellects, that of the heavenly souls,
and that of the good or wicked demons. If all these things were true, then all these
intermediate orders would be called by us &#8220;angels&#8221;, for Sacred Scripture refers to the demons
themselves as angels.

<P>8.&#8212;But the basis of this position is found to be without foundation, for it is not necessary that
what the intellect understands separately should have a separate existence (esse) in reality.
Hence, neither should we posit separate universals subsisting outside singulars nor likewise
mathematicals outside sensible things; for universals are the essences of particular things
themselves and mathematicals are certain limits of sensible bodies.

<p>First, he established by both reason and examples, the fact that everything moved is moved by
another; and that if something is said to be self-moved, this is not true of it according to the
same part but according to diverse parts of itself, so that one part is moving and another is
moved.

 Furthermore, since it is not possible to proceed to infinity among movers and things
moved, because if the first mover is taken away, it would follow that the other movers as
well, would not be moved, we must therefore arrive at some first unmoved mover and some
first movable which is moved by itself, in the manner already indicated; for that which is
through itself, is prior to and the cause of that which is through another.

<p>Furthermore, Aristotle aimed to establish the eternity of motion and that only an infinite
power can move in an infinite time, and likewise that no power belonging to a magnitude is
an infinite power.

 From these premises he concluded that the power of the first mover is not
a power belonging to any body; therefore the first mover must be incorporeal and without
magnitude.

  }
</script>
</p>
<p>9.&#8212;Again, since in the class of movable beings, that which is desirable is present as an
unmoved mover, whereas the one desiring is present as a moved mover, Aristotle further
concluded that the first unmoved mover is as an appetible good and that the first self-moved
mover, namely the first movable, is moved through a desire of that unmoved mover.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote36', WPFootnote36 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>

However, we must furthermore keep in mind that in the order of appetites and of appetible
objects, the first is that which is through itself an object of understanding, for intellective
appetite seeks that which is good through itself; whereas sensitive appetite cannot rise to the
appetition of that which is good in itself but only that which appears good. For that which is
simply and absolutely good does not fall under the apprehension of sense but only of the
intellect.</p>
<p>The first movable, therefore, seeks the first mover with an intellectual appetite and from this
it can be inferred that the first movable is appetitive and intelligent. And since only a body is
moved, we may infer that the first movable is a body animated by an intellectual soul. But the
prime movable, namely the first heavens, is not the only one moved with an eternal motion;
but also all the lesser spheres of the heavenly bodies likewise are.

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Therefore each of the
heavenly bodies is animated by its own soul and each has its own separate appetible object
which is the proper end of its motion.</p>
<p>10. -There are, accordingly, many separate substances that are in no way united to any bodies;
there are, likewise, many intellectual substances united to heavenly bodies. Aristotle attempts
to find out the number of these on the basis of the number of motions of the heavenly
bodies.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote38', WPFootnote38 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 But one of his followers, namely Avicenna
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote39', WPFootnote39 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
 assigns the number of these substances
not according to the number of motions but rather according to the number of the planets and
the other higher bodies, namely, the sphere of the fixed stars and the sphere without stars. For
many motions seem to be ordered to the motion of one star, and just as all the other heavenly
bodies are under one highest heaven by whose motion all the other bodies are revolving, so
likewise, all the other separate substances are ordered under the &#8216;first separate substance
which is the one God. And in like manner, all the souls of the other heavenly bodies are
ordered under the soul of the first heaven. Under the heavenly bodies according to Aristotle,
the only animated bodies are those of animals and plants.

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Between us and the heavenly
bodies, Aristotle did not locate any intervening animate body. Thus, according to the position
of Aristotle, between us and the highest God, there exists only a two-fold order of intellectual
substances, namely, the separate substances which are the ends of the heavenly motions; and
the souls of the spheres, which move through appetite and desire.</p>
<p>11.&#8212;Now this position of Aristotle seems to be surer because it does not depart greatly from
that which is evident according to sense; yet it seems to be less adequate than the position of
Plato.</p>
<p>In the first place, there are many things which are evident according to senses, for which an
explanation cannot be given on the basis of what Aristotle teaches. For we see in men who
are possessed by devils and in the works of sorcerers, certain phenomena which do not seem
capable of taking place except through some intellectual substance. Certain followers of
Aristotle, as is evident in Porphyry&#8217;s letter to Anebontes the Egyptian,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote42', WPFootnote42 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote42" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote42 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote42\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 tried to reduce the
causes of these phenomena to the power of the heavenly bodies, as if the works of the
sorcerers attained certain unusual and marvelous results under the influence of certain
constellations. Furthermore, they say that it is through the influence of the stars that persons
who are possessed sometimes foretell future events, for the realization of which there is a
certain disposition in nature through the heavenly bodies. But in such cases, there are
manifestly certain works which cannot in any way be reduced to a corporeal cause. For
example, that people in a trance should speak in a cultivated way of sciences which they do
not know, since they are unlettered folk; and that those who have scarcely left the village in
which they were born, speak with fluency the vernacular of a foreign people. Likewise, in the
works of magicians, certain images are said to be conjured up which answer questions and
move about, all of which could not be accomplished by any corporeal cause. Therefore, as the
Platonists see it, who could evidently assign a cause of these effects, except to say that these
are brought about through demons.</p>
<p>12.&#8212;Second because it seems unbefitting that immaterial substances should be limited to the
number of corporeal substances. For those beings that are higher do not exist for the sake of
those that are lower. But on the contrary, that because of which something else exists, is the
more noble. Now one cannot sufficiently ascertain the nature of an end from that which is for
the end, but rather the other way about. Hence, one cannot adequately ascertain the magnitude
and power of higher beings by a consideration of the lower ones. This truth is especially
evident in the order of corporeal beings, for it is impossible to reckon the magnitude and
number of heavenly bodies from the disposition of the elementary bodies, which are as
nothing in comparison to them. But the immaterial substances surpass corporeal substances
much more than the heavenly bodies surpass elementary ones. In view of this, the number,
power, and disposition of immaterial substances cannot be adequately grasped from the
number of heavenly movements.</p>
<p>13.&#8212;Let us assume the procedure and even the very words of Aristotle&#8217;s proof in order that
this truth may be more particularly made manifest. Now Aristotle assumes that there can be
no motion in the heavens unless it is ordered to the accomplishment of something.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote43', WPFootnote43 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote43\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 This
assumption is sufficiently probable. For all the substances of the spheres seem to exist for the
sake of the stars which are nobler among the heavenly bodies and have a more evident
influence. Aristotle further assumes that all the higher substances, impassible and immaterial,
are ends, being of themselves most excellent; and this assumption is reasonable.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote44', WPFootnote44 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote44\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For the
good has the nature of an end, and hence among beings, those that are by their very nature
noblest, are ends for other beings.</p>
<p>But the conclusion of Aristotle that the number of immaterial substances is determined by the
number of heavenly movements
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote45', WPFootnote45 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 does not necessarily follow. For an end is both proximate
and remote. And the proximate end of the highest heavens is not necessarily the highest
immaterial substance which is the all-high God, but it is more probable that there are many
orders of immaterial substances between the first immaterial substance and the heavenly
body. The lower of these immaterial substances is ordered to the higher as to an end and a
heavenly body is ordered to the lowest of these as to its proximate end. For each thing must in
some way be proportioned to its proximate end. Accordingly, because of the greatest possible
distance between the first immaterial substance and any corporeal substance, it is not
probable
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote46', WPFootnote46 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 that a corporeal substance should be ordered to the highest substance as to its
proximate end.</p>
<p>14.&#8212;Hence even Avicenna
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote47', WPFootnote47 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
 posited that the immediate end of any of the heavenly movements
was not the first cause but a certain first intelligence; and the same can likewise be said of the
lower motions of the heavenly bodies. Hence that there should not be more immaterial
substances than the number of heavenly motions is not a necessary fact. And Aristotle
himself, suspecting this fact, did not advance this position as necessary but only as probable.
For when he had enumerated the heavenly movements and before he offered the
aforementioned explanation, he states, &#8220;Accordingly, it is reasonable to posit so many
substances and immovable principles. But why it should be necessary, we shall leave to more
capable individuals to pronounce.&#8221;
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote48', WPFootnote48 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
 Aristotle therefore did not consider himself equal to the
task of reaching a necessary conclusion in such matters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it may seem to someone that Aristotle&#8217;s aforesaid reasoning for positing
immaterial substances is improper because it is based on the everlastingness of motion, which
is contrary to the truth of faith. But if we follow his reason carefully, we can see that his
argumentation still holds, even if the eternity of motion is denied. For, just as the infinite
power of a mover can be proved from the eternity of motion, so too, the same can be proved
from the uniformity of motion. For a mover that cannot always be in motion, must necessarily
move at one time faster and at another time more slowly according as his power gradually
slows down in motion. But in the domain of heavenly movements there is a complete
uniformity. We may therefore conclude that the mover of the first motion has the power to
move everlastingly and we would thus arrive at the same conclusion.

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW ARISTOTLE AND PLATO AGREE</span>
<P>15.&#8212;After having examined these points, we can easily determine wherein Plato&#8217;s and
Aristotle&#8217;s positions on the immaterial substances agree and wherein they differ.</p>
<p>In the first place, Plato and Aristotle agree on the manner of their existence. For Plato
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote50', WPFootnote50 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 held
that all lower immaterial substances are one and good by participation in the first, which is
essentially one and good. Now whatever participates in something, receives that which it
participates from the one from whom it participates; and to this extent that from which it
participates is its cause, just as air has light which it participates from the sun which is the
cause of its illumination. Therefore, according to Plato, the highest God is the reason why all
immaterial substances are each one of them one and good.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote51', WPFootnote51 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote51\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Aristotle, too, held this opinion
because, as he himself says, &#8220;that which is most being and most truth is the cause of being
and truth for all other things.&#8221;
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote52', WPFootnote52 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>16.&#8212;Secondly, Plato and Aristotle agree as to the condition of their nature, for both held that
all such substances are completely free of matter, although not free from the composition of
potency and act, for every participating being must be composed of potency and act. For that
which is received as participated, must be the act of the participating substance itself. And
thus, since Plato held that all substances below the highest, which is by itself one and good,
are participants, they are, of necessity composed of potency and act.

 This must likewise be
said according to Aristotle&#8217;s position, for he maintained that the nature of the true and the
good is attributed to act.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote54', WPFootnote54 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote54" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote54 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote54\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Hence, that which is the first truth and the first good must be pure
act. And whatever beings fall short of it, must have a certain admixture of potency.</p>
<p>17.&#8212;Thirdly, Plato and Aristotle agree on the nature of providence. Plato held that the highest
God, from the fact that He is the One itself and the Good itself, has as His property from the
root nature of goodness, to have providence over all lower things; and every lower thing
insofar as it participates in the goodness of the first good, likewise acts as a providence over
the things which come after it, and not only of the same order but of diverse orders as well.
Accordingly, the first separate intellect is a providence over the whole order of separate
intellects, and each higher intellect over a lower intellect; and the whole order of separate
intellects is a providence over the order of souls and the lower orders.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote55', WPFootnote55 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote55\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Plato thought that this same fact could be observed among souls themselves,
namely, that the highest souls of the heavens exercise a providence over all the lower souls
and over the whole generation of lower bodies; and in the same way, that the higher souls
exercise a providence over the lower ones
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote56', WPFootnote56 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote56\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 i.e., the souls of the demons over the souls of
men. For the Platonists held that demons acted as mediators between us and the higher
substances.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote57', WPFootnote57 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote57" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote57 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote57\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>With this view of providence, Aristotle likewise does not disagree. For he posits one separate
good, acting as a providence over all things in the manner of a single commander or master
under whom are diverse orders of things in such wise that the higher orders of things achieve
the order of perfect providence,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote58', WPFootnote58 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote58" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote58 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote58\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 and hence no defect is found in them. But lower beings
which are able to receive the order of a less perfect providence are open to many defects, just
as in a home, the children, who perfectly share in the rule of the father, fall short either in few
things or in none; whereas the actions of slaves are found to lack order in many respects.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote59', WPFootnote59 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote59\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>

Hence among inferior bodies, failings arise in the natural order [an order] which is never
found to be lacking among higher bodies. In the same way, human souls themselves
frequently fall short of the understanding of the truth and of the right appetite of the true good
but this is not found among the higher souls or intellects. For this reason, Plato himself
posited that certain demons were good and others were wicked, as were men; whereas the
gods, the intellects, and the souls of the heavens were completely without wickedness.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote60', WPFootnote60 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

These are the three points on which the opinion of Plato concerning the separate substances is
found to be in agreement with that of Aristotle.</p>
<br>
<A NAME="4"><p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">CHAPTER IV</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">HOW THE ABOVE POSITIONS OF PLATO AND ARISTOTLE DIFFER</span>
<BR>18.&#8212;There are other respects in which Plato and Aristotle differ: First, as has been said
above,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote61', WPFootnote61 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote61\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Plato posited above the souls of the heavens, a two-fold order of immaterial
substances, namely, the intellects and the gods. He declared these gods were the separate
intelligible Forms
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote62', WPFootnote62 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote62" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote62 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote62\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 by participation in which the intellects have understanding.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote63', WPFootnote63 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote63" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote63 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote63\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 But
Aristotle, since he did not posit any separate universals, posited only a single order of things
above the souls of the heavens. He held, moreover, that the first among these was the highest
God, just as Plato held that the highest God was first in the order of Forms, among which the
highest God is the very Idea of the One and the Good. But Aristotle held that this order
comprised both, namely, so that it was both understanding and understood, so that thus the
highest God would understand not by participation in something higher that would be His
perfection but through His own essence.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote64', WPFootnote64 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote64" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote64 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote64\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 And Aristotle likewise held the same opinion as to
the other separate substances ordered below the highest God,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote65', WPFootnote65 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote65" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote65 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote65\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 except that as they fall short of
the simplicity of the First and of His highest perfection, their understanding can be perfected
by participation in the higher substances.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote66', WPFootnote66 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote66" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote66 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote66\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Thus, according to Aristotle, such substances
which are the ends of the heavenly motions are both understanding intellects and intelligible
Forms.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote67', WPFootnote67 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote67" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote67 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote67\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 But this is not to be understood in the sense that they are the forms or natures of
sensible substances, as the Platonists asserted,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote68', WPFootnote68 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote68" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote68 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote68\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 but altogether higher forms.</p>
<p>They differ, secondly, because Plato did not restrict the number of separate intellects to the
number of heavenly movements. It was not on this account that Plato was moved to posit
separate intellects but rather by considering the very nature of things in themselves. Aristotle,
on the other hand, not wishing to be diverted from sensible things, came to posit separate
intellectual substances as a result of the sole consideration of motion, as we have said
above,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote69', WPFootnote69 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote69" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote69 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote69\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 and for this reason, limited the number of the substance&#8217;s to the number of heavenly
motions.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote70', WPFootnote70 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote70" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote70 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote70\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Third, they differ because Aristotle did not posit any souls intermediate between the souls of
the heavens and the souls of men, as did Plato.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote71', WPFootnote71 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote71\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Hence, we find that neither Aristotle nor any
of his followers has made mention of demons.This then is what we have gathered from
various writings concerning the opinions of Plato and Aristotle on the separate substances.

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE OPINION OF AVICEBRON AND HIS ARGUMENTS FOR IT</span>
<P>19.&#8212;Among those who came after Plato and Aristotle, some departed from their positions and
fell into error. First among these was Avicebron who, in the book <i>The Fount of Life</i>, held that
separate substances were of a different state.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote73', WPFootnote73 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 For he held that all substances established

</script>
 an opinion that disagrees both with the view of
Plato and the view of Aristotle.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote75', WPFootnote75 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote75\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Avicebron seems to have been twice deceived: First,
because he thought that according to the intelligible composition found in the genera of
things, inasmuch, namely, as a species is composed of genus and difference, there would
likewise be understood such a composition in things themselves, so that in the case of each
and every thing existing in a genus, the genus is matter and the difference is form.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote76', WPFootnote76 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote76" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote76 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote76\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Secondly,
because he thought that &#8220;to be&#8221; in potency, &#8220;to be&#8221; a subject, and &#8220;to be&#8221; a recipient would in
all cases be said according to one notion. Therefore, basing himself upon these two positions,
he proceeded in a certain reductive way in investigating the composition of all things up to
intellectual substances.</p>
<p>20.&#8212;In the first place, he noticed in the case of artificial things that they are composed of an
artificial form and of matter, which is a certain natural thing, for example, iron or wood,
which is disposed to the artificial form as potency to act.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote77', WPFootnote77 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote77" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote77 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote77\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Furthermore, he observed that such
particular natural bodies were composed of elements.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote78', WPFootnote78 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote78" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote78 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote78\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Hence he asserted that the four
elements are related to the particular natural forms, e.g., of stone or iron, as matter to form
and potency to act. Moreover, he noted that the four elements agree in that each one of them
is a body and they differ according to contrary qualities.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote79', WPFootnote79 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote79" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote79 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote79\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Hence in the third place, he held
that body itself is the matter of the elements, which matter he named universal natural matter,
and that the forms of this matter are the qualities of the elements. But because he observed
that a heavenly body agrees with the elements in corporeity but differs from them in not being
receptive of contrary qualities
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote80', WPFootnote80 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote80" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote80 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote80\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 he placed the matter of a heavenly body in a fourth order,
which likewise is related to the form of heavenly body as potency is to act. Avicebron thus
posited four orders of corporeal matter.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote81', WPFootnote81 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote81" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote81 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote81\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>21.&#8212;Again, because he saw that every body signifies a certain substance with length, width,
and thickness, he thought that the body, insofar as it is such a body, has three dimensions
which are as form; substance, which is the subject of quantity and the other genera of
accidents, is matter of the body so far as it is a body.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote82', WPFootnote82 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote82" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote82 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote82\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Thus, therefore, as he himself says, the
substance which supports the nine predicaments is the prime spiritual matter.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote83', WPFootnote83 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote83\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 And just, as he
posited in universal corporeal matter, which he called a body, something higher which was
not receptive of contrary qualities, (namely, the matter of the body of the heavens), and
something lower which is receptive of contrary qualities, which he believed to be the matter
of the four elements,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote84', WPFootnote84 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote84\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
&#8212;so likewise, in substance itself, he posited something higher which is
not receptive of quantity and which he considered to be a separate substance and something
lower which is receptive of quantity, which he posited as the incorporeal matter of bodies.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote85', WPFootnote85 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>22.&#8212;Furthermore, he asserted that the separate or spiritual substances themselves are
composed of matter and form. This he proved by several arguments:
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote86', WPFootnote86 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 First, because he held
that there would be no diversity among spiritual substances unless they were composed of
matter and form.

  }
</script>
 For if they are not composed of matter and form, they are either matter
alone or form alone. If they are matter alone, then spiritual substances cannot be many
because matter of itself is one and is diversified through forms. In like manner, if a spiritual
substance is form alone, no cause of the diversification of spiritual substances can be
assigned. For if you say that they are diverse according to perfection and imperfection, it
would then follow that spiritual substance is the subject of perfection and imperfection. But to
be a subject belongs to the nature of matter and not to the nature of form. Therefore, it
remains either that spiritual substances are not many or that they are composed of matter and
form.

</script>
</p>
<p>His second reason is that the concept of spirituality is outside the concept of corporeity. And
thus corporeal spiritual substances have something in which they differ and likewise in which
they agree since each is a substance. Hence, just as in the case of corporeal substance,
substance is as matter upholding corporeity, so in the case of spiritual substance, substance is
as matter upholding spirituality. And according as matter participates more or less in the form
of spirituality, spiritual substances are accordingly higher or lower, just as the finer the air is,
the more it participates in clarity.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote89', WPFootnote89 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>23.&#8212;His third reason is that <i>esse</i> is found in common among spiritual substances as in higher
beings, and in corporeal substances as in lower beings. Therefore, that which follows upon
esse in corporeal substances will also follow upon <i>esse</i> in spiritual ones. But a three-fold
order is found in corporeal substances, namely, a gross body which is the body of the
elements, a refined body which is the heavenly body, and finally, the matter and form of
body. Therefore, in a spiritual substance there is found a lower spiritual substance, for
example, one which is joined to a body, and a more excellent one which is not joined to a
body, and again, matter and form from which a spiritual substance is composed.

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>His fourth reason is that every created substance must be distinguished from the Creator. But
the Creator is one only. Therefore every created substance cannot be one only but must be
composed of two constituents, of which one must necessarily be form and the other matter,
because it cannot be composed of two matters or of two forms.

  }
</script>
</p>
<p>His fifth reason is that every created spiritual substance is finite. But a thing is finite only
through its form because a thing which does not have a form through which to become one, is
infinite. Therefore every created spiritual substance is composed of matter and form.

<p>24.&#8212;These arguments which we have set forth
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote93', WPFootnote93 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );

</script>
 are plainly improbable in many respects:</p>
<p>The first argument is unacceptable because Avicebron proceeds upward from the lower
beings to the highest ones by resolving
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote94', WPFootnote94 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 them into material principles, which is an argument
absolutely contrary to reason. For matter is compared to form as potency to act. Now it is
clear that potency is less a being than is act, for potency is said to be a being only according to
its order to act. Wherefore, neither do we say without qualification that the things which are
in potency exist; we say this only of things which are in act. Therefore, the lower one
descends by resolving to material principles, the less does one find of the character of being.
On the other hand, among beings the highest ones must be preeminently beings, for the
highest in every genus which are the principles of all the rest, are eminently said to exist in
the highest degree, just as fire is most hot.

</script>
 Accordingly, Plato, while investigating the
highest beings, proceeded by resolving them into formal principles, as has been said above.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote96', WPFootnote96 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>

Most unfittingly therefore, did Avicebron proceed in the opposite direction by resolving
beings into material principles.</p>
<p>25.&#8212;Second, because at least so far as appears from his own words, Avicebron in a way
returned to the opinion of the ancient Naturalists who held that all things were one being, by
positing that the substance of all things was nothing other than matter.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote97', WPFootnote97 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );

</script>
 This matter they did
not consider as something only in potency, as Plato and Aristotle did, but as some actual
being. There was this difference, however, that the ancient Naturalists, believing that only
bodies existed, said that this common matter and substance of all things was some body, as
for example, fire or air or water or something in between;
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote98', WPFootnote98 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote98\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 on the other hand, Avicebron,
thinking that the nature of things was not contained in bodies alone, said that that one
principle which he held to be the first matter and common substance of all things, was a non-corporeal substance.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote99', WPFootnote99 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote99\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 And that he posited this universal matter, which he says is the
substance of all things, in the same way in which the Naturalists posited this of some one
body, is clear from the fact that according to Avicebron, matter is the genus of those things
which agree in genus, while the differences by which the species differ, are forms.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote100', WPFootnote100 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>26. -For he says that the common matter of all material things is body itself.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote101', WPFootnote101 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote101\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 And again, the
common matter of all substances, both corporeal and spiritual, is substance itself.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote102', WPFootnote102 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote102\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );

</script>
 Therefore
it is clear that there is the same relation of the genus to its differences as of a subject to its
proper attributes. In other words, substance is divided into spiritual and corporeal, and body
into heavenly and elemental, just as number is divided into odd and even, and animal into
healthy and sick. Of these, number is the subject of the even and of the odd as of its proper
attributes, and animal is the subject of the healthy and the sick, with the subject and the
attributes being predicated of all the species. Thus, therefore, if the substance that is
predicated of all things, should be compared to <i>spiritual</i> and <i>corporeal</i> as the matter which is
their subject, it will follow that these two
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote103', WPFootnote103 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 come to substance in the manner of accidental
attributes. The same applies in all subsequent cases, as he himself expressly admits by
positing that all forms considered in themselves are accidents. They are said to be, however,
&#8220;substantial&#8221;, in comparison with certain things in whose definitions they are included, as
whiteness belongs to the definition of a white man.</p>
<p>27.&#8212;But this position destroys the true nature of prime matter. For if it is of the nature of
matter that it be in potency, then prime matter must be completely in potency.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote104', WPFootnote104 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 As a
consequence, it is not predicated of any actually existing thing, just as a part is not predicated
of the whole. This position likewise destroys the principles of logic by doing away with the
true nature of genus, species, and substantial difference, inasmuch as it reduces them all to the
mode of accidental predication.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote105', WPFootnote105 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Moreover, it destroys the foundations of natural philosophy
by remov,ing a true generation and corruption from things, as did the ancient Naturalists, in
positing one material principle. For a thing is said without qualification to be generated only
because it becomes without qualification a being.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote106', WPFootnote106 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For nothing which previously existed
comes to be. Therefore if it existed previously in act &#8212; which is for it without qualification to
exist &#8212; it will follow that it will not unqualifiedly become a being but rather a being which
previously was not. Therefore, it will be generated in a certain respect and not in an
unqualified manner.</p>
<p>28.&#8212;Finally and to reach a last conclusion, the aforementioned position also destroys the
principles of first philosophy by taking away unity from each thing and, as a consequence, the
true being and the diversity of things. For if to some being existing in act, another act is
added, the whole will not be one essentially but only accidentally because two acts or forms
are essentially diverse and agree only in subject.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote107', WPFootnote107 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote107\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 But to be one through the unity of the
subject is to be one accidentally, whether the two forms are not ordered to each other, as the
white and the musical, (for we say that the white and the musical are one accidentally because
they inhere in one subject), or whether the forms or the acts are ordered to one another as
color and surface. For that which is colored and has a surface is not absolutely one, though in
a way, the &#8220;colored&#8221; is essentially predicated of the surfaced thing, not indeed, because
&#8220;surfaced&#8221; signifies the essence of the &#8220;colored&#8221;, as genus signifies the essence of a species,
but because the subject is included in the definition of an accident; or otherwise the &#8220;colored&#8221;
would not be predicated of the surfaced thing essentially but the &#8220;surfaced&#8221; of the
&#8220;colored&#8221;.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote108', WPFootnote108 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote108\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Now in this way alone is a species one without qualification, namely, insofar as that which is
man is truly animal, not because animal is the subject of the form <i>man</i> but because the very
form <i>animal</i> is the form <i>man</i>, differing only as the indeterminate from the determinate. For, if
animal be one thing and biped something else, the biped animal that is man will not be
essentially one and consequently will not be essentially a being.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote109', WPFootnote109 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {

    document.write( WPFootnote109 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote109\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 As a consequence, it
follows that whatever things agree in the genus, will differ only by an accidental difference
and all things will be one in substance which is the genus and the subject of all substances;
just as the one part of a surface is white and the other part black, yet the whole is one surface.
For this reason, the ancients themselves who posited one matter which was the substance of
all things and predicated of all of them, asserted that all things were one. These difficulties
likewise beset those who posit an order of diverse substantial forms in one and the same
being.</p>
<p>29.&#8212;Third, following the method of the aforementioned position,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote110', WPFootnote110 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote110\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 it is necessary to proceed
to infinity among material causes, with the result that a first matter is never reached. For in all
things which agree in some point and differ in another, that in which they agree, they have as
their matter; and that in which they differ, they have as their form, as is clear from what has
been said.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote111', WPFootnote111 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote111" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote111 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote111\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 If, therefore, there is one common matter for all things for it to receive diverse
forms, it is then necessary that the more noble form should be received in a finer and more
excellent matter; the less noble form should be received in an inferior and coarser matter; for
example, the form of spirituality should be received in a more refined matter, whereas the
form of corporeity should be received in an inferior matter, as he himself says.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote112', WPFootnote112 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote112" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote112 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote112\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Prior to the
form of spirituality and of corporeity, there is therefore required in matter a difference of
fineness and coarseness. It is therefore again necessary that prior to the coarseness and
fineness, there pre-exist in matter some other difference through whichone matter is receptive
of the one and the other receptive of the other. The same question will re-appear concerning
those other pre-existent differences and so on to infinity. For as often as one arrived at one
completely uniform matter, according to the principles of the aforementioned position it
would be necessary that this matter should receive only one form and this equally throughout
the whole. And again the matter underlying that form would, as a consequence, receive only
one form and this uniformly throughout the whole; and thus by descending even to the lowest
of beings, no diversity could be found in things.</p>
<p>30.&#8212;Fourth, given the position of the ancient Naturalists that there was a prime matter as the
common substance of all things, it was possible to produce diverse things from it by
attributing diverse forms to diverse parts of this common substance.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote113', WPFootnote113 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote113" class="WPFloatStyle">' );

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote113\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For, since that
common matter was corporeal, there could be understood in it a division according to
quantity. But if we remove quantitative division, there remains only a division according to
form or according to matter. if, therefore, we posit a universal matter which is common to
every substance and which has no quantity in its nature, the division of this matter can be
understood only according to form or only according to the matter itself.</p>
<p>When, however, it is said that common incorporeal matter in part receives this form and in
part that form, a division of matter is presupposed to the diversity of the forms received in the
matter. That division, therefore, cannot be understood according, to some other forms. If,
therefore, it should be understood according to some forms, it must be understood according
to prior forms of which matter receives neither one through the whole of itself. Accordingly,
it is necessary again that we presuppose in matter some sort of division or distinction. This
distinction or division, too, will therefore be according to other forms to infinity, or we must
come to this, that the first division is according to the matter itself.</p>
<p>31.&#8212;Now there cannot be a division according to matter except because the matter is
distinguished through itself and not through a diverse disposition or form or quantity; for this
would mean that the matter is distinguished according to the quantity or form or disposition.
Therefore we must finally reach the conclusion that there is not one matter for all things but
that matters are many and distinct in themselves. Now it is proper for matter to be in potency.
This distinction of matter must therefore not be understood according as matter contains its
diverse forms or dispositions, for this is outside the essence of matter, but according to the
distinctions of potency with respect to the diversity of forms. For, since potency is called that
which is said relatively to act, it is necessary that potency be distinguished with respect to that
of which potency is primarily predicated.

 I say potency is primarily said in relation to
something in the manner in which the potency to see is said in relation to color but not to
white and black, since the same potency can receive both. In the same way, a surface can
receive white and black according to one potency which is primarily predicated with respect
to color. Avicebron therefore presupposed a clearly false principle when he said that potency
and reception are found in all in the same way.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">THAT OF SPIRITUAL AND CORPOREAL SUBSTANCES THERE CANNOT BE
ONE MATTER</span>32.&#8212;We may further conclude from this argument that there cannot be one matter for both
spiritual and corporeal substances. For if both have a single and common matter, there must
be understood in it a distinction prior to the difference of forms, namely, a distinction of
spirituality and corporeity. This disposition cannot be according to a division of quantity
because the dimensions of quantity are not found in spiritual substances.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote115', WPFootnote115 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Accordingly, it
remains that this distinction is either according to forms or dispositions or according to matter
itself; and since it cannot be according to forms and dispositions to infinity, we must finally
come back to this, that the distinction is present in matter according to matter itself. Therefore
the matter of spiritual substances will be absolutely other than the matter of corporeal
substances.</p>
<p>33.&#8212;Again, since it is the property of matter as such to receive, if the matter of spiritual and
corporeal substances is the same, then it is necessary that the mode of reception be the same
in both. The matter of corporeal things, however, receives the form in a particular way, that
is, not according to the common nature of form.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote116', WPFootnote116 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
 Nor does corporeal matter act in this way
insofar as it is subject to dimensions or to a corporeal form, since corporeal matter receives
the corporeal form itself in an individual way. Accordingly, it becomes clear that this befits
such a matter from the very nature of the matter which, since it is the lowest reality, receives
form in the weakest manner; for reception takes place according to the mode of the receiver.
Thereby matter, by receiving that form in a particular way, falls short in the greatest degree of
that complete reception of form which is according to the totality of the form. Now it is clear
that every intellectual substance receives the intellected form according to its totality, or
otherwise it would not be able to know it in its totality. For it is thus that the intellect
understands a thing insofar as the form of that thing exists in it.

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 It remains therefore that if
there be a matter in spiritual substances, it is not the same as the matter of corporeal things,
but much nobler and finer, since it receives form according to its totality.</p>
<p>34.&#8212;Again, as we consider the matter further, it becomes clear that a given being has a higher
place among beings according as it has a greater share in &#8220;to be&#8221;. It is clear, however, that
since being is divided by potency and act, act is more perfect than potency and has a greater
share in &#8220;to be&#8221;.

</script>
 For we do not say without qualification that what is in potency, is; we say
this only of what is in act. It is therefore necessary that that which is higher among beings
approach more closely to act, and that what is lowest among beings, be nearer to potency.
And since the matter of spiritual substances cannot be the same as the matter of corporeal
substances but is much higher as has been shown,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote119', WPFootnote119 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote119\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 it must be separated from the matter of
corporeal substances according to the difference of potency and act.</p>
<p>Now according to the opinion of Aristotle and Plato, the matter of corporeal things is pure
potency.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote120', WPFootnote120 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote120\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 It remains therefore that the matter of spiritual substances is not pure potency but
is something actual existing in potency. I am not saying &#8220;some thing actual existing in
potency&#8221; as though I meant some thing composed of act and potency, because either we
should have to proceed to infinity or we should have to arrive at something which was a being
only in potency; and since this being is the lowest among beings and consequently can receive
existence in a way which is weak and particularized, it cannot be the prime matter of a
spiritual and intellectual substance. It remains therefore that the matter of a spiritual substance
is in such wise a being in act that it be a subsisting act or form, just as the matter of corporeal
things is said to be a being in potency for the reason that it is the very potency which is
subject to forms.</p>
<p>35-Furthermore, whenever matter is posited as an actual being, it makes no difference
whether we call it the matter or the substance of a thing, For thus the ancient Natural
Philosophers, who held that the first matter of corporeal things was some actual being, said
that matter was the substance of all things in the same way that the substance of artificial
things is nothing other than their matter.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote121', WPFootnote121 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote121\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Therefore, if the matter of spiritual substances
cannot be only some potential being but is some actual being, then the matter itself of
spiritual beings is their substance. And in this case, there is no difference whether we posit
matter in spiritual substances or whether we hold that simple spiritual substances are not
composed of matter and form.</p>
<p>Furthermore, act is by nature prior to potency and form prior to matter and since potency
depends in its existence on act and matter depends on form, whereas form according to its
proper nature does not depend on matter for its existence, neither does act, (for that which is
by nature prior does not depend upon that which is by nature subsequent); &#8212; since this is the
case, if there are some forms which cannot exist without matter, this befits them not because
they are forms, but because they are such forms &#8216; namely, imperfect forms which cannot exist
through themselves of their own accord but need the foundation of matter.</p>
<p>36.&#8212;Now in all classes of being, prior to every thing imperfect, there is found something
Perfect. For example, if there is fire in a foreign matter upon which the fire according to its
nature does not depend, then it follows that the fire is not supported in the foreign matter.
Therefore above the forms received in matter, there are certain self-subsisting forms which
are spiritual substances not composed of matter and form. This fact also appears among the
lowest of the spiritual substances, namely souls, on the assumption that they are united to
bodies as forms. For it is impossible that that which is composed of matter and form be the
form of some body. For to be the form of some being is to be the act of that being. Hence no
part of that which is the form of some being can be matter, which is pure potency.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">ON THE REFUTATION OF AVICEBRON&#8217;S ARGUMENTS</span>
<P>37.&#8212;On this basis, it is easy to answer arguments advanced to the contrary. For the first
argument seemed to infer that there could not be diversity among spiritual substances if they
were not composed of matter and form.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote122', WPFootnote122 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }

 This argument was deficient in both parts of its
reasoning. For it is not necessary that those things which are only matter be without diversity,
just as it is likewise not necessary of those substances which are forms only. For we have
said
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote123', WPFootnote123 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote123\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 that since matter according to its nature is a being in potency, there must be diverse
matters according to the diversity of potency. Nor do we mean anything else by the substance
of matter than that very potency which is in the genus of substance. For the genus of
substance, like other genera, is divided by potency and act and hence nothing prevents certain
substances which are only potential to be diverse according as they are ordered to diverse
genera of acts; in which sense the matter of the heavenly bodies is distinguished from the
matter of the elements. For the matter of the heavenly bodies is in potency to perfect act, that
is, to a form which completes the whole potentiality of matter, so that there no longer remains
any potentiality to other forms. But the matter of the elements is in potency to incomplete
forms, which cannot exhaust the whole potency of matter. But above these matters, there is
spiritual matter, that is a spiritual substance, which receives a form according to its totality
while the lower matters receive their form in a particular way.</p>
<p>38.&#8212;In the same way, the inference based on the forms is also deficient.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote124', WPFootnote124 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 For it is clear that if
things composed of matter and form differ according to their forms, the forms themselves are
diverse through themselves. But if it be said that the forms of diverse things are not diverse
except because of the diversity of matter &#8212; just as diverse colors are caused by one
illumination of the sun in the air according to the diversity of the difference of density and
rarity in it &#8212;, it is necessary that prior to the diversity of the colors, there be understood in the
air a diversity of clearness and density. So, likewise, it is necessary that in matter, prior to one
form, another form be understood, just as in the case of bodies, prior to color, a surface is
understood. Therefore among forms, there is found a diversity according to a certain order of
perfection and imperfection. For that form which is nearer to matter is more imperfect and as
in potency with reference to a later form. Thus, although they are only forms, nothing
prevents us from positing a multiplicity among spiritual substances, on the basis that one is
more imperfect than the other, provided we do so in such wise that the more imperfect is in
potency in relation to the more perfect and so on upward to the first Form, which is act only,
namely, God; so that, in this way, lower spiritual substances can be called <i>matters</i> according
as they are in potency and <i>forms</i> according as they are in act.</p>
<p>39.&#8212;Therefore it is a clearly inconsequential objection that he brings forth against this view.
He concludes that if a spiritual substance differs according to perfection and imperfection, it
must be the subject of perfection and imperfection; and therefore since &#8220;subject&#8221; belongs to
the nature of matter, a spiritual substance must possess matter. In this argument, he is
deceived in two ways. He is deceived, first, because he thinks that perfection and
imperfection are certain supervening forms or accidents that a subject needs &#8212; which is
clearly false. For there is a certain perfection which a thing has according to its species and
substance, which is not compared to that thing as an accident to a subject or a form to matter,
but designates the proper species itself of the thing. For just as one number is greater than
another according to its own species, which is why unequal numbers differ in species, so,
among material forms and forms separated from matter, one is more perfect than another
according to the character of its own nature, insofar, namely, as the proper character of its
species consists in a given grade of perfection. Second, because to be a subject not only
follows upon the matter which is a part of substance but in general belongs to all potency. For
everything that is related to another as potency to act is naturally subject to it, and in this way,
likewise, a spiritual substance, although it does not have matter as a part of itself,
nevertheless, insofar as it is in some respect in potency, can be subject to intelligible forms.</p>
<p>40.&#8212;From this, the solution of the second argument
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote125', WPFootnote125 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote125\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 is likewise clear. For when we say that
a certain substance is corporeal or spiritual, we do not compare spirituality or corporeity to a
substance as forms to matter or accidents to a subject, but as differences to a genus, in such
wise, that a spiritual substance is spiritual not because of something added to substance, but
according to its proper substance, just as a corporeal substance is corporeal not because of
something added to substance but according to its own substance. For the form through which
the species receives the predication of the difference is not a form other than the one through
which it receives the predication of genus, as we have said before.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote126', WPFootnote126 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Hence, it is not
necessary that something should underlie the spirituality of substance as matter or subject.</p>
<p>41.&#8212;The third argument has no validity.

 For, since being is not predicated of all things
univocally, the same mode of &#8220;to be&#8221; is not required in all things that are said to be; rather,
some share in &#8220;to be&#8221; more perfectly, and some less perfectly.

 For accidents are called
beings, not because they have &#8220;to be&#8221; in themselves but because their &#8220;to bell lies in the fact
that they are in a substance.

</script>
 Again, there is not the same mode of &#8220;to be&#8221; in all substances.
For those substances which share in &#8220;to be&#8221; most perfectly, do not have in themselves
something which is a being only in potency. That is why they are called immaterial
substances. Below these, are those substances which, although they contain within themselves
a matter which according to its essence is a being in potency, yet they have a potentiality that
is entirely completed through form so that there remains in them no potentiality to another
form. They are therefore also incorruptible. Such is the case of the heavenly bodies which are
necessarily composed of matter and form. In fact, they must exist in act, otherwise, they could
not underlie any motion or be subject to sense nor could they be the principle of any action.
No one of them is form only because if they were forms without matter, they would be
substances that are actually intelligible and having understanding through themselves. This is
impossible, since to understand cannot be an act of a body, as is proved in the <i>De Anima</i>.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote130', WPFootnote130 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>It remains, therefore, that they are composed of matter and form. But just as <i>that</i> particular
body underlies this particular magnitude and determinate figure so that it is not in potency to
another magnitude or figure; so, the matter of the heavenly bodies is so subject to <i>this</i> form
that it is not in potency to another form. Below these substances, there is a third grade of
substances, namely, that of corruptible bodies which in themselves have a matter that is a
being only in potency. Yet the whole potentiality of such a matter is not realized through the
one form to which it is subject, so that there does not remain in it a potency to other forms.
And according to this diversity of matter, this potentiality in bodies is found the more finely
and the more grossly according as the heavenly bodies are finer and more formal than the
bodies of the elements. And since form is proportioned to matter, it follows that the heavenly
bodies likewise have a nobler and more perfect form, inasmuch as it realizes the full
potentiality of matter. Therefore among the higher substances to which the potency of matter
is completely foreign, there is found a difference of greater or lesser refinement according to
the difference in the perfection of the form; but there is in them no composition of matter and
form.</p>
<p>42.&#8212;The fourth argument has no validity.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote131', WPFootnote131 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For given that spiritual substances have no matter,
it does not follow that they are not distinguished from God. For if we take away the
potentiality of matter, there remains in them a certain potentiality insofar as they are not &#8220;to
be&#8221; itself but they share in &#8220;to be&#8221;.

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For there can be only one being which is &#8220;to be&#8221; itself;
just as some form, if it should be considered by itself, can be only one. That is why the things
which are diverse in number are one in species because the nature of the species considered in
itself is one. just as therefore it is one according to the consideration of it while it is being
considered, so it would be one in being if it existed through itself. The same argument applies
to the genus in relation to species, until we reach the &#8220;to be&#8221; itself which is most common.
There is therefore only one &#8220;to be&#8221; subsisting through itself.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote133', WPFootnote133 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 Hence it is impossible that
other than it, there should be something which is &#8220;to be&#8221; alone. Now everything that is, has a
&#8220;to be&#8221;. Therefore in every being other than the first, there is present both a &#8220;to be&#8221; itself as
the act, and the substance having the &#8220;to be&#8221; as a potency receptive of the act of &#8220;to be&#8221;.

<p>43.&#8212;It is possible for one to say that that which participates in something, of itself lacks that
thing; just as a surface which has the nature to participate in color, considered in itself is not
color and not colored. In the same way, accordingly, that which participates in &#8220;to be&#8221; must
itself be a non-being. That which is a being in potency and participative of being but is not of
itself being, is matter as was said above.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote135', WPFootnote135 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

  }
</script>
 Thus, therefore, since every being that is after the
First Being, which is &#8220;to be&#8221; itself, is a being by participation, it has matter.</p>
<p>But it must be observed that the beings which share &#8220;to be&#8221; from the First Being, do not share
in it according to a universal mode of being as it is found in the First Principle; they
participate in it in a particular way, according to a certain determinate mode of being which
belongs to this given genus or this given species. Now each thing is adapted to one
determinate mode of being according to the mode of its substance. But the mode of every
substance composed of matter and form is according to the form through which it belongs to
a determinate species. Thus, a thing composed of matter and form is made through its form to
receive a share in &#8220;to be&#8221; itself from God according to a mode proper to it.</p>
<p>44. -A two-fold order, therefore, is found in a substance composed of matter and form. One is
the order of the matter to form, and the other is the order of the composite thing itself to the
participated &#8220;to be&#8221;.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote136', WPFootnote136 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( WPFootnote136 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote136\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For the &#8220;to be&#8221; of a thing is neither its form nor its matter but
something coming to the thing through the form.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote137', WPFootnote137 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote137\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Consequently, in things composed of
matter and form, the matter considered in itself, according to the mode of its essence, has &#8220;to
be&#8221; in potency, and this it has as a result of a certain participation in the First Being;
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote138', WPFootnote138 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )

    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote138" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote138 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote138\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 but,
considered in itself, it lacks the form through which it participates actually in &#8220;to be&#8221;
according to the mode proper to it.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote139', WPFootnote139 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote139\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Now a composite being, considered in its essence, already has a form but it participates in its
own &#8220;to be&#8221; through its own form. Therefore because matter receives an actual determinate
&#8220;to be&#8221; through a form and not conversely, there is nothing to prevent the existence of a form
which receives the &#8220;to be&#8221; in itself, not in some subject. For a cause does not depend on the
effect, but rather conversely. In this way, therefore, a form subsisting through itself
participates in &#8220;to be&#8221; in itself just as a material form participates in its subject. If, therefore,
when I say &#8220;non-being&#8221;, the effect is to remove only the &#8220;to be&#8221; in act, the form, considered
in itself, is non-being but sharing in &#8220;to be&#8221;. But if &#8220;non-being&#8221; removes not only the &#8220;to be&#8221;
in act but also the act or the form through which something shares in &#8220;to be&#8221;, then, in this
sense, matter is non-being, whereas a subsistent form is not non-being but an act which is a
form that can participate in the ultimate act which is the &#8220;to be&#8221;.</p>
<p>It is clear therefore wherein the potency which is found in spiritual substances differs from
the potency found in matter. For the potency of a spiritual substance is measured only
according to its order to &#8220;to be&#8221;, whereas the potency of matter is measured according to its
order both to a form and to &#8220;to be&#8221;. If someone were to say that both potencies are matter, it is
clear that he is using the word &#8220;matter&#8221; equivocally.</p>
<p>45.&#8212;The solution of the fifth argument
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote140', WPFootnote140 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote140\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );

</script>
 is already apparent from what we have said.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote141', WPFootnote141 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 For
since a spiritual substance participates in &#8220;to be&#8221;, not according to the infinity of its
community, as is the case in the First Principle, but according to the mode proper to its
essence, it is clear that its &#8220;to be&#8221; is not infinite but finite. Nevertheless, since the form itself
is not participated in matter, in this respect, it is not limited by the mode by which forms
found in matter are limited.</p>
<p>Thus therefore we see a certain gradation of infinity in things. For a material substance is
finite in a two-fold manner, namely, on the part of the form which is received in matter and
on the part of the &#8220;to be&#8221; itself, in which it shares according to its own mode, as being finite
from below and from above. A spiritual substance, however, is finite from above, inasmuch
as it receives &#8220;to be&#8221; from the First Principle according to its proper mode; it is infinite from
below, insofar as it is not received in a subject. But the First Principle, God, is infinite in
every way.</p>

</script>
 by taking away from those substances the simplicity
of immateriality, so, concerning their mode of being, we find that certain people have strayed
from the truth by taking away from spiritual substances an origin in a first and highest
Author. On this point there was a three-fold error among different thinkers.</p>
<p>For, in the first place, some of them said that the aforementioned substances had absolutely
no cause of their &#8220;to be&#8221;.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote144', WPFootnote144 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote144\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Others held that these substances had indeed a cause of being but
they did not proceed immediately from the highest and first Principle but the lower ones
among them derived their being from the higher ones according to a certain orderly
succession.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote145', WPFootnote145 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote145\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Still others admit that all these substances have the origin of their being
immediately from the First Principle; but in the case of their other attributes, for example, in
that they are living, intelligent, and the like, the higher substances are as causes for the lower
ones.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote146', WPFootnote146 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote146\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>47.&#8212;In the first place, then, they hold that spiritual substances are completely uncreated. They
derive this opinion from the things which are caused according to matter, and they base
themselves on the common physical assumption of the philosophers as their principle,
namely, that from nothing nothing comes.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote147', WPFootnote147 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 That thing seems to become which has a cause of
its &#8220;to be&#8221;. Whatever, therefore, has a cause for its &#8220;to be&#8221;, this must come from another.
Now that from which another becomes, is matter. If, therefore, spiritual substances have no
matter, it seems to follow that they have absolutely no cause of their &#8220;to bell.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote148', WPFootnote148 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Again, &#8220;to become&#8221; is a certain kind of &#8220;to be moved&#8221; or &#8220;to be changed&#8221;. Now there must be
some subject for all change and motion, since motion is the act of something existing in
potency.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote149', WPFootnote149 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote149\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Therefore some subject must pre-exist for everything that becomes. Hence, if
spiritual substances are immaterial, they cannot have been made.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote150', WPFootnote150 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote150" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote150 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote150\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Again, in any given making, when we arrive at the final &#8220;having been made&#8221;, there remains
nothing to be made, just as after the last &#8220;having been moved&#8221;, there remains no &#8220;to be
moved&#8221;. But in the case of those things that are generated, we see that each one of them is
then said to have been made, as meaning that the making is finished, when it receives its
form. For the form is the term of generation. Therefore when the form is acquired, nothing
remains to be made. Therefore that which has a form does not become a being; it <i>is</i> a being
according to its form. If then something is in itself a form, this does not become a being. Now
spiritual substances are certain subsistent forms as is clear from what has already been said.
Therefore spiritual substances do not have a cause of their &#8220;to be&#8221; in the sense of having been
made by another.</p>
<p>One could likewise argue to the same effect from the opinion of Aristotle and Plato who hold
that such substances are everlasting.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote151', WPFootnote151 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote151\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 But nothing everlasting seems to be something made,
since a being comes to be from non-being, as white comes to be from non-white. It seems to
follow, then, that what comes to be, previously did not exist. Consequently, if spiritual
substances are everlasting, it follows that they are neither made nor do they have a principle
and cause of their &#8220;to be&#8221;.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote152', WPFootnote152 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>48. -But if one were to consider the matter correctly, he will find that this opinion and the
previous opinion which attributes matter to spiritual substances, proceed from the same
source. For the previous opinion proceeded from the fact that Avicebron, unable to transcend
the imagination, considered that spiritual substances were of the same nature as the material
substances which are perceived by sense.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote153', WPFootnote153 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 So, too, the present opinion seems to proceed
from the fact that the intellect cannot be raised to see a mode of causing other than the one
which is suited to material things. For human ability seems to have progressed slowly in
investigating the origin of things. In the beginning, men thought that the origin of things
consisted only in an external change, by which I mean an external origin that takes place
according to accidental changes.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote154', WPFootnote154 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );

</p>
<p>For those who were first to philosophize about the natures of things held that to become is
nothing other than to be altered, so that the substance of things which they called matter, is a
completely uncaused first principle.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote155', WPFootnote155 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 For they were not able by their intellect to hurdle the
distinction between substance and accident. Others, proceeding a little further, likewise
investigated the origin of the substances themselves, asserting that certain substances had a
cause of their &#8220;to be&#8221;. But because they were not able by their minds to see anything beyond
bodies, they did indeed reduce corporeal substances to certain principles but corporeal
principles, and they posited that other substances come to be through the combining of certain
bodies, as though the origin of things consisted solely in combining and separating.

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
</p>
<p>Later philosophers proceeded by reducing sensible substances into their essential parts, which
are matter and form. Thus they made the &#8220;becoming&#8221; of physical things to consist in a certain
change, according as matter is successively made subject to different forms.

<p>But beyond this mode of becoming, it is necessary according to the teaching of Plato and
Aristotle, to posit a higher one.

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For, since it is necessary that the First Principle be most
simple, this must of necessity be said to be not as participating in &#8220;to be&#8221; but as itself being
&#8220;to be&#8221;. But because subsistent &#8220;to be&#8221; can be only one, as was pointed out above,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote159', WPFootnote159 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

 then
necessarily all other things under it must be as participating in &#8220;to be&#8221;. Therefore there must
take place a certain common resolution in all such things according as each of them is
reduced by the intellect into that which is and its &#8220;to be&#8221;. Therefore, above the mode of
coming to be, by which something becomes when form comes to matter, we must presuppose
another origin for things according as &#8220;to be&#8221; is bestowed upon the whole universe of things
by the First Being that is its own &#8220;to be&#8221;.</p>
<p>49.&#8212;Again, in every order of causes, a universal cause must exist prior to the particular cause,
since particular causes act only in the power of universal causes. Now it is clear that every
cause that makes something through motion is a particular cause, since it has a particular
effect. For every motion is <i>from</i> this determinate point <i>to</i> that determinate point, and every
change is the terminus of some motion. Therefore, over and above the mode of becoming by
which something comes to be through change or motion, there must be a mode of becoming
or origin of things, without any mutation or motion through the influx of being.</p>
<p>Further, that which exists by accident must be reduced to that which exists through itself.
Now in every thing that comes to be through change or motion, there comes to be that which
is in itself this or that being. But &#8220;being&#8221; taken in its community, comes to be accidentally,
for it does not arise from non-being but from non-being <i>this</i>, as if dog arises from horse. To
use the example of Aristotle, if a dog were to come to be from a horse, that which is
essentially a dog comes to be, but an animal does not come to be essentially but only
accidentally, since animal existed previously.

 It is therefore necessary to consider in things
a certain origin according to which &#8220;to be&#8221; taken in its community, is granted essentially to
things-which transcends all change and motion.</p>
<p>And if one should consider the order of things, he will always find that that which is most
such is always the cause of those things that come after it. For example, fire which is hottest,
is the cause of heat in other elementary bodies.

 Now the First Principle which we call God
is most a being. For in the order of things, we cannot proceed to infinity but we must come to
something highest because it is better to be one than to be many. But that which is better in
the universe, must necessarily be because the universe depends on the essence of God&#8217;s
goodness. Therefore the First Being must of necessity be the cause of being for all things.</p>
<p>50.&#8212;Having seen these points,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote162', WPFootnote162 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 we can easily solve the arguments brought forth. That the
ancient Naturalists assumed as a first principle that nothing comes to be from nothing was
due to the fact that they were able to reach only a particular mode of coming to be, namely,
that which is through change and motion.</p>
<p>The second argument likewise was based on this mode of coming to be. For among things
which come to be through change or motion, a subject is presupposed to the making, but in
the highest mode of coming to be, which takes place through the influx of being, no subject is
presupposed to the making; for according to this kind of making, for a subject to come to be
is for the subject to participate in &#8220;to be&#8221; through the influence of a higher being.</p>
<p>So, too, the third argument is likewise based on the coming to be, which is through change or
motion. For when the form is reached, there will be no further motion. Nevertheless, we must
understand that through its form, a generated thing receives its &#8220;to be&#8221; from the universal
cause of being. For the causes that are acting towards the production of determinate forms are
causes of being only insofar as they act in the power of the first and universal principle of
being.</p>
<p>51.&#8212;The fourth argument likewise applies in the same way to those things which come to be
through change or motion, in which it is necessary that non-existence precede the existence of
things that come to be, for their &#8220;to be&#8221; is the terminus of a change or motion. But in those
things which come to be without change or motion through a simple emanation or influx, we
are able to understand that something has been made without including that at some time, it
did not exist. For when change or motion has been removed, there is not found in the action
of the causal principle, the succession of &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221;. It is therefore necessary that
the effect which is produced through the influence of a cause be so related to that influencing
cause while it is acting, in the same way that things which come to be through motion are
related to their acting cause at the terminus of the action that exists through motion; for at that
time, the effect then exists. Therefore, in the case of those things that come to be without
motion, it is necessary that the produced effect be simultaneous with the influx of the acting
cause. If, however, the action of the acting cause be without motion, no disposition will come
to the agent so that he might be able to act afterwards when previously he could not do so,
because this disposition would already be a certain change. Hence he could always act by an
influx. Therefore the effect produced can be understood to have always existed. And this
appears somewhat among corporeal things themselves. For in the presence of an illuminating
body, light is produced in the air without any preceding change of the air. Accordingly, if the
illuminating body had always been present to the air, the air would always have light from it.</p>
<p>52.&#8212;But this appears more clearly in the case of intellectual beings which are more removed
from motion. For the truth of the principles is the cause of the truth in conclusions that are
always true. For there are certain necessary things which have a cause of their necessity, as
Aristotle himself says in the fifth book of the <i>Metaphysics</i>:

 Therefore, although Plato and Aristotle did posit that immaterial substances or
even heavenly bodies always existed, we must not suppose on that account that they denied to
them a cause of their being.

</script>
 For they did not depart from the position of the Catholic faith
by holding such substances to be uncreated, but because they held them to have always
existed &#8212; of which the Catholic faith holds the contrary.</p>
<p>For although the origin of certain things be from an unmoved principle without motion, it is
not necessary that their &#8220;to be&#8221; be everlasting. For an effect proceeds from any given agent
according to the mode of the &#8220;to be&#8221; of the agent. Now the &#8220;to be&#8221; of the First Principle is His
&#8220;to understand&#8221; and &#8220;to will&#8221;. Therefore the universe of things proceeds from the First
Principle as from a being that understands and wills. But it belongs to one understanding and
willing to produce something not of necessity as it itself is, but as it wills and understands.
Now in the intellect of the first understanding being, there is included every mode of being
and every measure of quantity and duration. Therefore, just as the First Principle did not give
to things the same mode of being by which He exists and enclosed the quantity of bodies
under a determinate measure &#8212; since all measures are contained in His power as well as in
His intellect &#8212; so He gave to things such a measure of duration as He willed, not as He has.
Accordingly, just as the quantity of bodies is enclosed under a given measure, not because the
action of the First Principle is determined to this measure of quantity but because a measure
of quantity actually follows as the intellect of the cause has prescribed; so, too, from the
action of the First Cause, there follows a determinate measure of duration because the divine
Intellect so prescribed; not, indeed, in the sense that God is subject to successive duration, so
that He now wills or does something which He previously did not will, but because the whole
duration of things is included under His Intellect, so that He determines from eternity the
measure of duration that He Wills for things.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">THE OPINION OF AVICENNA ON THE COMING OF THINGS FROM THE FIRST
PRINCIPLE AND ITS REFUTATION</span>
<BR>53.&#8212;Therefore, other thinkers, considering these and similar points, assert that all things do
indeed derive the origin of their being from the first and highest Principle of things Whom we
call God, yet they do not do so immediately but in a certain order. Since the First Principle of
things is absolutely one and simple, they thought that only that which is one proceeded from
Him. And although this effect be more simple and more one than all the other lesser things, it
falls short of the simplicity of the First Principle, insofar as it is not its own &#8220;to be&#8221; but is a
substance having &#8220;to be&#8221;. This substance they call the First Intelligence, from which they say
that it is possible for a plurality of beings to proceed. For according as the First Intelligence is
turned to the understanding of its simple and first Principle, they say that the second
intelligence proceeds from it. Then, according as it understands itself in terms of the
intellectuality in it, it produces the soul of the first sphere; but according as it understands
itself in terms of that which is potential within it, the first body proceeds from it.

</p>
<p>54.&#8212;But it is immediately evident that this position is open to criticism. For the good of the
universe is stronger than the good of any particular nature. Since the nature of the good and of
the end is the same, if anyone withdraws the perfection of the effect from the intention of the
agent, he destroys the nature of the good in the particular effects of nature or art. For this
reason, Aristotle criticized the opinion of the ancient Naturalists, who posited that the forms
of the things that are generated by nature and other natural goods are not intended by nature
but come about from the necessity of matter. All the more unbefitting is it therefore that the
good of the universe proceed not from the intention of the universal agent but by a certain
necessity in the order of things. Moreover, if the good of the universe which consists in the
distinction and order of its parts, does come from the intention of the first and universal
agent, then it is necessary that the very distinction and order of the parts of the universe
preexist in the intellect of the First Principle. And because things proceed from Him as from a
principle with an intellect, which acts in accordance with conceived forms, we may not posit
that from the First Principle &#8212; granting that It is simple in Its essence &#8212; there proceeds only
one effect; and that it is from another being, according to the mode of its composition and
power, there proceeds a multitude, and so on. This would mean that such a distinction and
order in things proceeded from a certain necessity in things and not from the intention of the
first Agent.</p>
<p>55.&#8212;Now it can be replied that the distinction and order of things does indeed proceed from
the intention of the First Principle, which intends to produce not only the first effect but also
the whole universe; yet this happens according to a certain order so that the First Principle
produces the first effect immediately and through the mediation of the first effect, He brings
things into being in a certain order. But since there is a twofold mode of producing things,
namely, one according to change and motion, and the other, without change and motion &#8212; as
we have already said above

 &#8212; in the mode of production which takes place through
motion, we clearly see that some things come to be from the First Principle through the
mediation of second causes. For thus we see plants and animals brought into being through
motion according to the powers of higher causes, in an orderly way extending to the First
Principle. But in the mode of production that takes place without motion through a simple
influx of &#8220;to be&#8221; itself, this cannot take place. But in the mode of production according to
which a thing is brought into being, not only does it itself come to be this thing, but it itself
comes to be a being absolutely, as we have said.

<p>56.&#8212;But there must be a proportion between effect and causes so that, namely, a particular
effect corresponds to a particular cause and a universal effect to a universal cause. just as
therefore, when through motion some thing itself comes to be this being, an effect of this sort
is reduced to a particular cause that moves towards a determinate form, so too, when some
thing comes to be absolutely and not by accident a being, this effect must be reduced to the
universal cause of being. This, however, is the First Principle, namely God. By way of change
and motion, certain effects can be brought into being by the First Principle through the
mediation of second causes; but according to that mode of production which takes place
without motion, called creation, an effect

 is reduced to God alone as its Author. In this way,
alone, can immaterial substances be brought into being, as well as the matter of such bodies
as could not exist prior to form, as we have said concerning the matter of the heavenly bodies
which is not in potency to other forms.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote172', WPFootnote172 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 It remains, therefore, that all immaterial substances
and the heavenly bodies, which cannot be brought into being through motion, have God alone
as the Author of their being. And therefore, that which is prior among them is not the cause of
being for those that come later.</p>
<p>57.&#8212;Moreover, the higher a cause, by so much the higher and more universal is it and by so
much does its power extend to more things. But that which is found to be prime in each and
every being is especially common to all beings, for whatever is added, contracts that which is
given as prior, for that which is understood in a thing as subsequent in reality is related to the
prior as act is to potency. But potency is determined through act. Thus, therefore, that which
is first in each and every thing must be the effect of the highest power. But the later the effect
is, the more it is reduced to the power of a lower cause. Therefore that which is found to be in
each and every being &#8212; as matter in bodies and what is proportional to immaterial substances
&#8212; is the proper effect of the prime power of the universal agent. Consequently, it is
impossible that certain things should be brought into being by second causes, without
presupposing the effect of a higher agent; and thus, no agent after the first, brings a thing as a
whole into being, in the sense of producing a being absolutely in itself and not accidentally &#8212;
which is to create, as we have said.

<p>58.&#8212;Again, a given nature or form has a two-fold cause: one, which is essentially and
absolutely the cause of such a nature or form; the other, which is the cause that such a nature
or form is in such a being. The necessity of this distinction is apparent to any one considering
the causes of the things which axe generated. For when a horse is generated, the generating
horse is indeed the reason why the nature of horse begins to exist in this being, but it is not
the essential cause of equinity. For that which is essentially the cause of a certain specific
nature, must be the cause of that nature of all the beings that have that species. Since, then,
the generating horse has the same nature, it would have to be its own cause, which is
impossible. It remains, therefore, that above all those participating in equinity, there must be
some universal cause of the whole species. This cause the Platonists posited as a Form
separate from matter in the manner in which the principle of all artifacts is the artistic form
that does not exist in matter.

 According to Aristotle&#8217;s opinion, however, this universal

</script>
 But when
something is caused through motion, the common nature comes to some preexisting being
through the coming of a form to matter or to a substance. For in this way, something that has
that nature in a particular way, can be through motion the cause of some being, as man is the
cause of man or a horse the cause of horse. When a thing is not caused through motion, then
such a making refers to the nature itself according to itself. Therefore it must be reduced to
that which is essentially the cause of that nature, but not to something which participates in
that nature in a particular way. For such a making is compared to the procession or causality
which is found in intelligibles, in which the nature of a thing according to itself depends only
on a First Principle, just as the nature and essence of six do not depend on three or two but on
unity itself. For according to the very nature of its species, six is not twice three but once six;
otherwise, there would have to be many substances of one thing. Consequently, when the
being of some thing is caused without motion, the causality involved cannot be attributed to
any one of the particular beings that participate in being; it must be reduced to the universal
and first cause of being, namely God, Who is being itself.</p>
<p>59.&#8212;Further, the more distant a potency is from act, the greater the power it needs to be
reduced to act. For a fire of a greater strength is needed to melt stone than to melt wax. But as
between no potency and some potency howsoever undisposed

</script>
 there is no
proportion; for between non-being and a being there is no proportion, for the power which
produces an effect from no preceding potency infinitely exceeds the power which produces an
effect from some potency, however remote it might be. Now an infinite power can belong to
other things in a qualified sense, but an infinite power with respect to all of being can belong
only to the first agent, which is its own being, and is thereby in all ways infinite, as we said
above.

 Such, however, must be the production of all ingenerable

<P>60.&#8212;Influenced by these reasons, the Platonists held that in the case of all immaterial

according to the aforementioned mode of production which is without change or motion.

But they posited a certain order of causality in the aforementioned substances according to

 the Platonists posited
abstract principles according to the order of our intelligible conceptions. This would mean
that just as unity and being are most common and are the first to fall in the intellect, after
which comes life, then intellect and so forth, so likewise, the first and highest among these
separate principles is that which is being itself, and this is the First Principle, God, of Whom
we have said that He is His own being.

 Under this principle, they posited another separate
principle, life, and again, another, intellect. If, therefore, there be some immaterial substance
which is intelligent, living, and being, it will be a being through participation in the First
Principle which is being itself; it will be living through participation in the second separate
principle which is life; and it will be intelligent through a participation in another separate
principle which is the intellect itself.

<p>61.&#8212;Now this position can be true in a certain way but, absolutely speaking, it cannot be true.
For among those qualities which come accidentally to some being, nothing prevents that
which is prior from coming from a more universal cause and that, which is subsequent, from
coming from some subsequent principle. For example, animals and plants paxticipate in heat
and cold from the elements but they obtain the determinate mode of complexion which
pertains to their own species from the seminal power through which they are generated. Nor
is it awkward that a thing have quantity or be white or hot from different principles. But this
is absolutely impossible in the case of substantial attributes. For all attributes which are
predicated of some thing substantially, are essentially and absolutely one. Now a single effect
is not reduced to several first principles according to the same notion of principle because an
effect cannot be simpler than its cause. Whence, Aristotle himself uses this argument against
the Platonists, namely, that if animal were one thing and biped another thing in separate
principles, then there would not be &#8220;one two-footed animal&#8221; without qualification.

 If,
therefore, among immaterial substances, that which is the &#8220;to be&#8221; were different from the &#8220;to
live&#8221; and from the &#8220;to be intelligent&#8221; in such a way that &#8220;living&#8221; would come to an existing
being or &#8220;being intelligent&#8221; would come to a living being as an accident to a subject or form
to matter, then what is said would be correct. For we see that something is the cause of the
accident which is not the cause of the subject, and something is the cause of the substantial
form that is not the cause of matter. But in immaterial substances, their &#8220;to be&#8221; itself is their
&#8220;to live&#8221;, and their &#8220;to live&#8221; is not other than their &#8220;to be intelligent&#8221;. Therefore they are
living and understanding from the same principle that they are beings. Therefore if all
immaterial substances have their being immediately from God, then they have immediately
from Him their life and intelligence. And if anything comes to them over and above their
essence, for example, intelligible species or the like, in this respect, the position of the
Platonists can hold, namely, that such qualities among lower immaterial substances may have
been derived according to a certain order from higher ones.</p>

taught that they proceeded from the First Principle not immediately but according to a certain

 For it was his opinion that diverse and unequal
things could not proceed from an author who is one and just unless some diversity were
presupposed. But no diversity could precede the first production of things by God, which
presupposes nothing at all. Whence he posits that all the things which were first produced by
God were equal. Hence, because bodies cannot be made equal to non-bodily substances, he
posited that there were no bodies in the first production of things. Afterwards, when the
things had been produced by God, a diversity entered creation as a result of the diversity in
the motions of the will of the non-bodily substances which, of their nature, have freedom of
choice.</p>
<p>According to this view, some of them, turning to their principle

 by an orderly motion of
their will, advanced in goodness, and this diversely, according to the diversity of their
voluntary motion. Whence, some among them were made superior to others. Some others,
however, were turned away from their principle by a disorderly motion of the will and these
deteriorated in goodness, some more and some less; so that this was the occasion for the
production of bodies, namely, that non-bodily substances having turned away from the order
of the good, might be bound to them as having fallen down to the level of a lower nature.
Whence Origen was wont to say that the whole diversity of bodies was based on the diversity
in the disorderliness of the voluntary motion of non-bodily substance, so that those that had
turned in a lesser way from God, were bound to nobler bodies, and those that were turned
away more, were bound to less noble bodies.</p>
<p>63-The principle of this position is groundless and the position itself is impossible. The
ground of this impossibility can be gathered from what we have already said. For we said
above that spiritual substances are immaterial.

 If, therefore, there is any diversity in them,
this must be according to a formal difference. Now among those beings which differ by a
formal difference, no equality can be found, for every formal difference must be reduced to
the first opposition which is the opposition of privation to form.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote190', WPFootnote190 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote190\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Therefore, among all
beings that differ formally, the nature of one that is imperfect with respect to another is
related to that other in the disposition of privation to form. And this is apparent to us in the
diversity of the species known to us. Thus among animals and plants and metals and
elements, we find that a difference of species proceeds according to the order of nature so that
step by step, nature rises from the lower to the most perfect. This is likewise apparent in the
species of colors and flavors and other sensible qualities. But in things which differ
materially, nothing prevents things that have the same form from being equal. For diverse
subjects can participate in the same form either equally or by excess and defect.
Consequently, it would be possible for all spiritual substances to be equal, if, having
specifically the same form, they differed only in matter. And perhaps this is what Origen
thought them to be by not distinguishing noticeably between spiritual and corporeal natures.
But because spiritual substances are immaterial, there must be an order of nature among
them.</p>
<p>64.&#8212;Further, according to this position, it is necessary that spiritual substances be either
imperfect or superfluous. For we do not find a multitude of beings on the same grade of
nature except through some imperfection of any one of them or because of the necessity of
continuing in existence, so that those things that cannot endure in numerical sameness, might
endure through multiplication; just as among corruptible things, we find many individuals
equal according to the nature of the species; or through the necessity of some operation for
which the power of one is not sufficient but the power of many must be joined together as
constituting one complete power, as is evident in a number of warriors and in a multitude of
persons pulling a boat. But those things whose power is complete and which are enduring in
the order of their nature are not multiplied numerically in the equality of the same species.
For there is only one sun which suffices for permanent endurance and to produce all the
effects which belong to it according to the grade of its nature; the same is clear in the case of
the other heavenly bodies. But spiritual substances are much more perfect than even the
heavenly bodies. Therefore, there is not among them a multitude in the same grade of nature,
for, since one of them is sufficient, others would be superfluous.</p>
<p>65.&#8212;Again, the aforementioned position takes away the perfection of goodness from the
universe of things produced by God. For the perfection of each and every effect consists in
this, that it is likened to its cause,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote191', WPFootnote191 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
 for that which according to its nature is something
generated is then perfect, when it reaches the likeness of its generator. Artifacts are likewise
made perfect when they achieve the form of the art. But in the case of the First Principle, we
recognize not only that He is good, and being, and one, but also that He possesses this
perfection above and beyond all other things and that He leads other things to a participation
in His own goodness. Therefore, the perfect assimilation of the universe produced by God
requires not only that each thing be good and be a being, but also that one thing should excel
another and that one thing should move the other to its end. Hence the good of the universe,
like the good of an army, is the good of an order.

 Accordingly, the aforementioned position,
by establishing a complete equality in the production of things, takes away the good of order
from the universe of things.

</p>
<p>Moreover, it is unbefitting to attribute that which is best in the universe to chance. For that
which is best has most especially the nature of the intended end. Now the good of order is that
which Is best in the universe of things, for this is the &#8220;common good; while other goods are
singular goods. This order, which is now found in things, the aforementioned position
attributes to chance according, namely, as it happens that one spiritual substance is moved in
a certain way according to its will, and another spiritual substance in another way. Therefore
the above opinion must be completely rejected.</p>
<p>66.&#8212;Furthermore, the basis of this position is clearly absurd. For the same notion of justice is
not involved in the constitution of some whole out of several and diverse parts and in the
distribution of some thing common among singulars. For he who intends to make a given
whole, aims that the whole be perfect and accordingly, brings together diverse and unequal
parts to its constitution. For if all the parts were equal, then the whole would not be perfect,
which is evident both in a physical whole and in a civil whole.

 For the body of man would
not be perfect, unless it had members that are diverse and of unequal importance, nor would
the body politic be perfect unless there were found in it unequal conditions and diverse
offices. But in the distribution of something common, the concern is with the good of each
singular; and therefore diverse things are assigned to diverse beings according to a preexisting
diversity in them, in accordance with which, diverse things befit them. Therefore in the first
production of things, God brought forth diverse and unequal things in being, looking to that
which the perfection of the universe requires and not to any preexisting diversity in things.
But He will look to this point in the rewarding of final judgment by giving to each according
to his merit.</p>

error concerning the knowledge and the providence of these substances. For in wanting to

<p>For, since in our own case, it is the sense that deals with singulars whereas the intellect,
because of its immateriality, deals not with singulars but with universals, as a consequence,
they thought that the intellects of spiritual substances which are much more simple than our
intellect, could not grasp singulars. Now since they axe completely incorporeal, there is in
spiritual substances no sense, whose operation cannot take place without a body.
Accordingly, they thought that it was impossible for spiritual &#8220;substances to have any
knowledge of singulars.

the one understanding, for it is thus that the intellect becomes actively understanding. Now
nothing other than God is nobler than He so that it can be His perfection. Therefore, they hold
that it necessarily follows that God understands only His own essence.

 where he
proves that if we posit that every effect has an essential cause and that, given any cause
whatsoever, its effect must necessarily be posited, it will follow that all futures will happen of
necessity, since any future effect will be reduced to some preceding cause, and that to another
and so on, until we come to the cause which already is or already was. But this cause is now
posited because it is in the present or it was in the past. If, therefore, to posit the cause means
necessarily for the effect to be posited, then all future effects will follow of necessity. But if
all things that are in the world, are subject to the divine providence, the cause of all things is
not only present or past but has preceded them from eternity. But it is not possible that when
this cause is posited, its effect will not follow. For the divine providence on which no defect
falls, is not thwarted either through ignorance or through the impotence of the one providing.
Therefore if follows that all things come about of necessity.

<p>69.&#8212;Further, if God is the good itself, the order of His providence must necessarily proceed
according to the nature of the good. Therefore either divine providence is inefficacious or it
completely excludes evil from things. We see, however, many evils occurring among
singular, generable, and corruptible things, and especially among men in whom, in addition to
physical evils which are natural defects and corruptions common to them and to other
corruptible things, there are added also the evils of vices and of disorderly happenings, as
when numerous evils befall the just, and good things happen to the unjust. On this account,
therefore, some people have thought that divine providence extends only to immaterial
substances and the incorruptible and heavenly bodies, in which they saw no evil. But the
lower beings, according to them, were subject to the providence of &#8216;God in genus but not
individually nor to other spiritual substances.</p>
<p>70.&#8212;And because the things which have been said above are opposed to the common opinion
of mankind and this, not only of men in general but also of the wise, we must show by certain
arguments that the above positions have no truth and that the above arguments do not
establish the conclusion they intend. This applies first to the knowledge of God and secondly,
to His providence.</p>
<p>Now we must, of necessity, hold firmly this point, namely, that God has a most certain
knowledge of all things that are knowable at any time or by any knower whatsoever. For as
we have maintained above,

</script>
 the substance of God is His very act of being. Furthermore, His
being and His understanding are one and the same; otherwise, He would not be a perfectly
simple being nor the absolutely prime being. Therefore, just as His substance is His act of
being, so is His substance His understanding or His intelligence as likewise the Philosopher
concludes in <i>Metaphysics</i> XII.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote202', WPFootnote202 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Just as therefore His substance is His separate act of being,
so likewise, is His substance His separate understanding. But if there should be some separate
form, nothing that could belong to the nature of that form would be lacking to it, just as if
there were a separate whiteness, nothing understood under the nature of whiteness would be
lacking to it. Now the knowledge of any knowable is included under the universal nature of
knowing. Therefore God cannot be lacking in the knowledge of any knowable.</p>
<p>But the knowledge of any knower is according to the mode of his substance, just as any
operation is according to the mode of the one operating. All the more so, divine knowledge
which is God&#8217;s substance, is according to the mode of His being. Now His being is one,
simple, abiding, and eternal. It follows therefore that by one simple glance, God has an
eternal and fixed knowledge of all things.</p>
<p>71.&#8212;Further, that which is abstract

  }
</script>
 can be only one in each nature. For if whiteness could
exist as abstracted, the only whiteness would be the one that is separate and all the others
would be white by participation. Now just as the sole substance of God is His separate
existence, so His substance is His absolutely separate understanding. All other things
consequently understand or know by participation, just as they are by participation. But that
which befits a being by participation is found more perfectly in that in which it is essentially
and from which it is derived to others.

 Therefore God must have a knowledge of all things
which are known by any being whatsoever. And therefore the Philosopher considers it
unfitting that something which is known by us should be unknown to God, as is clear in <i>On
the Soul</i> I

<p>72. -Likewise, if God knows Himself, He must know Himself perfectly because if His
understanding is His substance, then whatever is in His substance must be included in His
knowledge. But when the substance of anything is known perfectly, its power must likewise
be known perfectly. God therefore knows His power perfectly and consequently He must
know all the things to which His power extends. But His power extends to everything that in
any way is in reality or can be, &#8212; whether it be proper or common, immediately produced by
Him or through the mediation of second causes &#8212; since the power of the First Cause acts on
the effect more than does the power of a second cause.

 Therefore God must have a
knowledge of all things that in any way are found in things.</p>
<p>Furthermore, just as the cause is in a manner present in its effect through a participated
likeness of itself, so, every effect is in its cause in a more excellent way according to the
power of the cause. Therefore all things must exist more eminently in their First Cause, which
is God, than in themselves. But whatever is in a thing, must be in it according to the
substance of that thing. But the substance of God is His understanding. Therefore, however
things may be in reality, they must exist in God in an intelligible way according to the
eminence of His substance. Therefore God must know all things most perfectly.</p>

</script>
 we must show that they do not attain to the Philosopher&#8217;s intention.
Therefore it must be known that according to the Platonists, an order of intelligibles existed
prior to the order of intellect, so that an intellect became actually understanding by
participating in an intelligible, as we have already said.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote210', WPFootnote210 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 And in the same way Aristotle
showed earlier in the same book that above the intellect and the intellectual appetite by which
the heavens are moved, there is a certain intelligible, participated by the intellect moving the
heavens. His words are: &#8220;The receiver of the intelligible substance and of the intellect acts as
possessing them,&#8221;
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote211', WPFootnote211 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 as if to say it actually understands as it already possesses its participated
intelligible from above. And from this, he further concludes that that intelligible is more
divine. And after he has interposed certain matters, he raises the question concerning the
intellect of this most divine being by participation in which the mover of the heavens is
actually understanding.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote212', WPFootnote212 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
</p>
<p>For if that most divine being does not understand, he will riot be something outstanding but
will act as one who is asleep. But if he understands, the first query will then be how he
understands. For if he understands by participating in something else above him &#8212; just as a
lower intellect understands by participating in him &#8212; it will follow that there will be
something else which will be a principle with respect to it, because by the fact that he
understands by participating in another, he is not understanding through his own essence; so
that his substance is not his understanding, but rather, his substance will be in potency in
relation to understanding.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote213', WPFootnote213 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For this is the condition of the substance of any participating
being in relation to what it obtains by participation. And thus, it further follows that that
divine being will not be the most excellent substance &#8212; which is contrary to the position.</p>
<p>74.&#8212;As a result, he advances another query concerning that which is understood about the
noblest substance. Whether it be granted that the first substance is its very understanding or
whether its substance is an intellect that is compared as potency to understanding, there will
be a question as to what it is that the first substance understands.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote214', WPFootnote214 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote214\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For it understands either
itself or something other than itself. If it be granted that it understands something other than
itself, there will arise the further query whether it always understands the same thing, or at
one time one thing and at another time another. And because some one could say that it
makes no difference what it understands, Aristotle raises on this point the query whether it
makes some difference or none in any being to understand something good or to understand
something contingent.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote215', WPFootnote215 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote215\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 And he answers in reply to this query that to know certain things is
trivial. The meaning of this statement can be two-fold: either that it is trivial to know
concerning certain things, whether to understand them is as good as to understand certain
other things, whether much lesser or much greater. The other meaning is that in our own case
it seems trivial for us to have an actual understanding of certain things. Whence another
reading has it, &#8220;Or meditating about certain things something is inappropriate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having determined that it is better to understand something good than to understand
something less good, he concludes that what the first substance understands is the best; and
that in understanding, it is not changed so that it understands now one thing and now another.
He proves this in a two-fold way: First, since it understands that which is noblest, it would
follow, as has been said,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote216', WPFootnote216 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( WPFootnote216 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote216\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 that if it were changed to some intelligible object, then there
would be change to something less noble. Secondly, because such a change of intelligibles is
already a certain motion.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote217', WPFootnote217 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( WPFootnote217 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote217\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 The first being, however, must be in every way immobile.</p>
<p>75.&#8212;He then returns to the resolution of the first question, namely, whether God&#8217;s substance is
His understanding. This, he proves in a two-fold way as follows: First, because if His
substance is not His understanding but is as potency to it, it is probable that to understand
without stop would be laborious to Him.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote218', WPFootnote218 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  if( bInlineFloats )
  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote218" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote218 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote218\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 He says that it is &#8220;probable&#8221; because that is how it
happens in our own case. But since this can happen in our case not because of the nature of
the intellect but because of the lower powers that we use in understanding, he therefore did
not say that this is necessary in all cases. If, however, this probability is accepted as true, it
will follow that it might be laborious for the First Substance to understand without stop and
therefore it will not be able to understand everlastingly, which is contrary to what has been
accepted.</p>
<p>Secondly, he proves it by the fact that if His substance were not His understanding, it would
follow that something else would be nobler than His intellect, namely, the known thing,
through participation in which, it becomes understanding.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote219', WPFootnote219 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

  {
    document.write( '<span id="WPFootnote219" class="WPFloatStyle">' );
    document.write( WPFootnote219 );
    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote219\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For whenever a substance is not
its own understanding, the substance of the intellect must be ennobled and perfected by the
fact that it understands some intelligible actually, even if this object be a most humble one.
For every thing by which some thing becomes actual, is more noble than it. Hence it would
follow that some most humble intelligible is nobler than the intellect which is not
understanding through its essence. Hence this must be denied, namely, that something else
understood by Him is the perfection of the divine intellect because the nobility of the thing
itself understood belongs to the perfection of His act of understanding. This point is manifest
from the fact that in our case, among whom the substance of the knower differs from actual
knowledge, it is more worthy for certain things not to be seen than to be seen. And so if it be
thus in the case of God, that His intellect is not His understanding and that He understands
something else, then, His understanding will not be the best because it will not have the best
intelligible object.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote220', WPFootnote220 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 It remains, therefore, since He is the noblest of things, that He
understands Himself.</p>
<p>76.&#8212;It is therefore apparent to anyone who considers carefully the above words of the
Philosopher, that it is not his intention to exclude absolutely from God a knowledge of other
things, but rather, that God does not understand other things through themselves as
participating in them in order that He then may become understanding through them; as
happens in the case of any intellect whose substance is not its understanding. He rather
understands all things other than Himself by understanding Himself, inasmuch as His being is
the universal and fontal source of all being and His understanding is the universal root of
understanding encompassing all understanding.

<p>The lower separate intellects, however, that we call angels, understand themselves in each
case through their essence, but according to the Platonists&#8217; position, they understand other
things by participating in the separate intelligible forms that they call gods, as we have said.

According to Aristotle&#8217;s principles, they understand other things partly through their essence

 must
extend to the least of things, so it is necessary that the care of divine providence should enfold
all things. For in all things the good is to be found in a certain order, according as things help
one another and are ordered to an end.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote224', WPFootnote224 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 Just as every being is derived from the First Being
Who is His own act of being, so it is necessary that every good be derived from the First
&#8216;Good Who is goodness itself. Therefore the order of individuals is derived from the first and
pure Truth, from which, however, something is derived according to its manner, namely, in
an intelligible way. And in this the nature of providence consists, that an order be established
by an understanding being in the things that are subject to its providence. Therefore all things
must be subject to the divine providence.</p>
<p>Further, the First Unmoved Mover, Who is God, is the source of all motions, just as the First
Being is the source of all beings. In essentially ordered causes, something is by so much more
a cause, according as it is prior in the order of causes, since it confers on others that they be
causes. Therefore according to this, God is more strongly the cause of all motions than are the
individual moving causes themselves. Now God is the cause of something only as
understanding, since His substance is His understanding, as is clear from the words of
Aristotle mentioned above.

 Each thing, however, acts according to the mode of its
substance. Therefore God moves all things to their proper ends through His intellect and this
is providence. Therefore all things are subject to divine providence.</p>
<p>78.&#8212;Moreover, things are arranged in the universe in the best way because all of them depend
on the highest goodness. But it is better for certain things to be ordered essentially rather than
accidentally. Therefore the order of the whole universe is not accidental but essential. But that
certain things be ordered essentially, it is required that the intention of the First Cause be
directed even to the last. For if the First Cause intends to move the second, and Its intention
goes no further, if the second then moves the third, this will be outside the intention of the
First Mover; therefore such an order will be accidental. Consequently the intention of the
First Mover and Orderer, namely God, must extend not only to certain beings but even to the
very last ones. Therefore all things are subject to His providence.</p>
<p>Likewise, that which befits a cause and an effect is found more eminently in the cause than in
the effect for it flows into the effect from the cause. Accordingly anything that is found in
lower causes and is attributed to the First Cause of all, belongs to it in a most excellent way.
But some providence must be attributed to God, or otherwise the universe would be moved
by chance. Therefore divine providence must be most perfect.</p>
<p>79.&#8212;Two things, however, must be considered in providence: These are disposition and the
execution of what has been disposed in which, in a way, a different kind of perfection is
found. For in disposition, providence is the more perfect as the one providing is more able
with his mind to consider and order individual things. Accordingly, all operative arts are
considered the more perfect as each one of them is more able to join together singulars.With
respect to execution, however, providence seems to be the more perfect according as the one
providing moves as a more universal agent through more intermediaries and instruments.
Therefore, divine providence has an intelligible disposition of each and every thing but it
executes what it disposes through many and varied causes. Among these, the spiritual
substances whom we call angels, because they are closer to the First Cause, carry out the
divine providence in a more universal way. Accordingly, the angels are the universal
executors of the divine providence; whence they are pointedly called &#8220;angels&#8221;, that is,
&#8220;messengers&#8221;, for it belongs to messengers to carry out what God has disposed.</p>

 alleged, that the intellect of God and the angels cannot
know singulars if the human intellect cannot know them. And that the nature of this
difference might appear more clearly, we must consider that the order of knowledge is
according to the proportion of the order found in things according to their being. For the
perfection and truth of knowledge consists in this, that it has the likeness of the things known.
In things, however, the order that obtains is that the higher among beings have being and
goodness more universally; not indeed, that they should come to have being and goodness
only according to their common nature &#8212; insofar as the universal is said to be that which is
predicated of many &#8212; but because whatever is found in lower beings is found more
eminently in the higher; and this is seen from the operative power that is found in things.</p>
<p>For lower beings have powers which are restricted to determinate effects, whereas higher
beings have powers that extend universally to many effects; and yet, a higher power among
particular effects, is more effectual than a lower power; and this is especially evident among
bodies. For in lower bodies, fire heats through its own heat and the seed of this animal or
plant so determinately produces an individual of this species, that it does not produce an
individual of another species.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote227', WPFootnote227 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
</p>
<p>It is clear from this that among higher beings, a power is called universal not because it does
not extend to particular effects but because it extends to more effects than does a lower power
and acts more strongly on singulars among them.</p>
<p>81.&#8212;In this way, therefore, the higher the knowing power, the more universal it is; not indeed,
in such a way that it knows only a universal nature, for thus the higher it would be, the more
imperfect it would be. For to know something universally is to know it imperfectly and, in a
manner, midway between potency and act. But a higher knowledge is called more universal
on this account, that it extends to more individuals and knows singulars better. In the order of
knowing powers, however, the sensitive power is lower and thus it can know singulars only
through the proper species of singulars.</p>
<p>And because matter is the principle of individuation among material things, hence it is that
the sensitive power knows singulars through individual species received in corporeal organs.
Among intellectual cognitions, however, that of the human intellect is the lowest. Therefore
intelligible species are received in the human intellect according to the weakest mode of
intellectual knowledge, so that through them, the human intellect can know things only
according to the universal nature of genus or species; to the representation of which, in its
sole universality, the species are determined and in a manner limited by the fact that they are
abstracted from the phantasms of singulars. And thus man knows singulars, through the sense
but universals through the intellect. But the higher intellects are of a more universal power in
knowing, so that, namely, they axe able to know both the universal and the singular through
an intelligible species.</p>
<p>82.&#8212;The second argument has no force.

 For when it is said that the thing understood is a
perfection of the one understanding, this indeed is true according to the intelligible species
which is the form of the intellect so far as it is actually understanding. For it is not the nature
of the stone in matter that is the perfection of the human intellect, but the intelligible species
abstracted from the phantasms through which species the intellect understands the nature of
the stone. Accordingly, since every form that is by derivation in some being must proceed
from an agent, and since an agent is more noble than the patient or recipient, it is necessary
that the agent from which the intellect has an intelligible species is more perfect than the
intellect; just as in the case of the human intellect, we see that the agent intellect is nobler
than the possible intellect, which receives species made actually intelligible by the agent
intellect. But the physical things themselves that are known are not nobler than the possible
intellect. The higher intellects of the angels, however, receive intelligible species either from
the Ideas &#8212; according to the Platonists

</script>
 and what is in reality true.</p>
<p>The intelligible species of the divine intellect, however, through which it knows all things, is
nothing other than his substance, which is likewise his understanding as was proved above
through the words of the Philosopher.

 Hence it remains that in the case of the divine
intellect there is nothing nobler through which it is perfected; but from the divine intellect
itself as from a higher source, intelligible species come to the intellects of the angels; whereas
to the human intellect, intelligible species come from sensible things through the action of the
agent intellect.</p>
<p>83. -It is easy to solve the third argument.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote232', WPFootnote232 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 For nothing prevents something from being
fortuitous and by chance, when it is referred to the intention of a lower agent which, yet, is
ordered according to the intention of a higher agent. This is evident if some person
treacherously sends someone else to a certain place where he knows that there are robbers or
enemies. For the one who is sent, the meeting with these persons is fortuitous, being beyond
his intention. But it is not by chance to the sender who knew this in advance. Consequently,
nothing prevents certain things from taking place fortuitously or by chance so far as pertains
to human knowledge, which yet axe ordered according to divine providence.</p>
<p>84.&#8212;We can derive the answer to the fourth argument
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote233', WPFootnote233 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote233\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 from the fact that the necessary order
of consecution of an effect to cause must be understood according to the nature of the cause.
For not every cause produces an effect in the same way. A natural cause does it through a
natural form, through which it is in act. Therefore a natural agent must produce an effect like
unto itself. A rational cause, however, produces an effect according to the nature of an
understood form which it intends to bring into being; and thus an intellectual agent produces
such an effect as it understands should be produced, unless the producing power fail.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whatsoever power is concerned with the production of any genus, must be
concerned with the production of the proper differences of that genus. For example, if it
pertains to some one to make a triangle, it likewise pertains to him to make an equilateral or
isosceles triangle. For the necessary and the possible are proper differences of being.
Therefore it pertains to God, to Whom the power to produce being properly belongs, to give
to things produced by Him according to His foreknowledge, either the necessity or possibility
of being. Therefore it must be conceded that divine providence, preexisting from eternity is
the cause of all the effects which axe made in accordance with it and which proceed from it
by an immutable disposition. Nevertheless all do not so proceed as to be necessary. But just
as the providence of God disposes that such effects be, so it likewise disposes that certain of
these effects be necessary for which it has ordained necessarily acting proper causes, while
certain others should be contingent for which it has ordained proper contingent causes.</p>
<p>85.&#8212;The answer to the fifth argument
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote234', WPFootnote234 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote234\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 is evident from these points. For just as from God
Whose being is essentially and supremely necessary, there proceed contingent effects because
of the condition of their proper causes, so likewise, from Him Who is the highest good there
proceed certain effects which, to be sure, are good in that they exist and are from God; and
yet they are affected by certain defects of secondary causes because of which they are called
evil. But this, too, is a good, namely, that such effects are allowed by God to take place in
reality, both because it befits the order of things, in which the good of the universe consists,
that effects follow according to the condition of their causes, and also because from the evil
of one, the good of another arises; just as in natural things the corruption of one thing is the
generation of another; and in the case of moral realities, from the persecution of the tyrant
there follows the patience of the just person. Accordingly, it was not fitting that evils should
be completely prevented through divine providence.</p>

posited both principles to be corporeal, saying that the author of good things was a certain

</script>
 These notions which we have just set
down, contain a manifest falsity as can be seen if we take them up one by one.</p>
<p>87.&#8212;In the first place, it is completely irrational that something should be posited as the first
principle of evils as contrary to the highest good. For nothing can be active except insofar as
it is a being in act because each being produces something else like itself; and furthermore, a
thing is produced in order to be actually.</p>
<p>Now we call each thing &#8220;good&#8221; because it achieves act and its proper perfection; and it is evil
because it is deprived of its due act and perfection. For example, life is a good of the body,
for the body lives according to the soul, which is its perfection and its act. Hence, death,
through which the body is deprived of the soul, is called an evil of the body. Nothing
therefore acts or is done except insofar as it is good.</p>
<p>However, insofar as anything is evil, to that extent it falls short of being done perfectly or of
acting perfectly. For example, we say that a house is badly built if it is not brought through to
its due perfection, and we call a builder &#8220;bad&#8221; if he falls short in the art of building. Therefore
evil as such neither has an active principle nor can it be an active principle, but follows from
a defect of some agent.</p>
<p>88.&#8212;In the second place, it is impossible for any body to be intellective or to have an
intellective power. For the intellect is neither a body nor is it the act of a body; otherwise, it
would not know all things, as the Philosopher proves in the third book of <i>On The Soul</i>.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote239', WPFootnote239 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>

Therefore if they admit that the First Principle has intellective power &#8212; which is held by all
who speak of God it is impossible for the First Principle to be something corporeal.</p>
<p>89. -Thirdly, it is clear that the good has the nature of an end, for we call that thing good,
towards which the appetite tends. All government however is according to an order to some
end, and according to the nature of this order, the things that are directed to the end are
ordered to it. Now all government is according to the nature of good. Therefore evil as evil
cannot have a government or a dominion or rulership. In vain, therefore do they posit two
kingdoms or governments, one of the good and the other of the evil.</p>
<p>This error like those mentioned above

</script>
 seems to have come about because the Manicheans
tried to transfer to the universal cause of things, what we find among particular causes. They
saw particular contrary effects proceed from particular contrary causes, for example that fire
heats and water causes cold. Hence, they believed that this process from contrary effects to
contrary causes holds right up to the first principles of things. And because all contraries are
seen to be contained under good and evil, insofar as one of two contraries is always deficient,
for example, the black and the bitter, and the other is realized, as the sweet and the white, for
this reason they thought that good and evil are the first active principles of all things.</p>
<p>90.&#8212;But they manifestly failed in considering the nature of contraries. For contraries are not
altogether diverse, but they agree in one respect and differ in another. For they agree in genus
and they differ according to specific differences. Therefore, just as there are contrary
proximate causes of contraries, so far as they differ by their specific differences, so they have
one common cause of the whole genus in which they agree. A common cause, however, is
prior to and higher than the proper causes. For the higher a cause is, by so much is its power
greater and reaching out to more effects. It remains, therefore, that contraries are not the first
active principles of things but that there is one active cause of all things.</p>

 teaches most firmly that
all spiritual substances &#8212; like all other creatures &#8212; were made by God, and this is proved by
the authority of the canonical scriptures. For it is said in the Psalms,

 that &#8220;The celestial substances are first and in many
ways made in the participation of God.&#8221; And in the fourth chapter of <i>On The Divine

 he says that &#8220;Because of the rays of divine goodness, all intelligible and intellectual
substances and powers and operations were established. Because of these rays, they are and
live and have an inexhaustible life.&#8221;</p>
<p>92. -Furthermore, that all spiritual substances and not only the highest were immediately
produced he expressly states in the fifth chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>:
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote249', WPFootnote249 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 &#8220;The existing
powers of the most holy and exalted and, as if, on the threshold of the super-substantial
Trinity, have been established by It and in It they have both being and being in a God-like
way. And after those they are subjected,&#8221; that is the lower to the higher. &#8220;Subjected,&#8221; that is
they have being from God in a lower way; &#8220;and the lowest&#8221;, that is at the bottom;
&#8220;extremely&#8221;, that is in the lowest manner with respect to the angels but the highest, however,
with respect to us. Through this statement, he gives us to understand that all the orders of
spiritual substances are established by divine disposition and not from the fact that one of
them is caused by another. And this is said more expressly in the fourth chapter of the
<i>Celestial Hierarchy</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote250', WPFootnote250 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
 &#8220;It is fitting&#8221;, he says, &#8220;for the cause of all things and of the goodness
which is above all, to call to its communion all those things which are, so that each being
which is should be determined by a proper analogy.&#8221; For He established each thing in the
order which befits its nature.</p>
<p>93.&#8212;Likewise, it is repugnant to Christian teaching that spiritual substances should have
goodness, being, and life, and other such attributes that pertain to their perfection, from
different principles. For in the canonical scriptures, it is attributed to the one and the same
God that He is the very essence of goodness. Accordingly it is said in Matthew 19:17, &#8220;One is
good, God&#8221;: and that He is being itself &#8212; therefore in Exodus 3:14, God answers Moses who
asks what is God&#8217;s name, &#8220;I am Who am&#8221;; and that He Himself is the life of living beings &#8212;
accordingly it is said in Deuteronomy 3:20, &#8220;He is the life of the living.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this truth, Dionysius most expressly teaches in the fifth chapter of <i>On the Divine
Names</i>,

 when he says that Sacred Scripture &#8220;... does not say that to be good is one thing and
to be a being is another and that life or wisdom is something else, nor that there are many
causes and lesser productive deities of whom some extended to some things and others to
others.&#8221; In this statement he removes the opinion of the Platonists who posited that the very
essence of goodness was the highest God,

 And he adds, &#8220;But the opinion
saysthat all the good processions belong to one, i.e., one deity,&#8221; namely because both being
and life and all other such characteristics proceed to things from the highest deity.</p>
<p>This point he explains at greater length in the eleventh chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>

saying, &#8220;For we do not say that a certain divine or angelic substance is through itself the esse
which is the cause that all things are; for only the super-substantial being itself (namely of the
highest God) is the principle and substance and cause that all things are by nature&#8221; &#8212; a
principle which is indeed productive, a substance in the manner of an exemplary form and a
cause which is final. And he adds: &#8220;Nor do we say that there is any other deity that generates
life besides the super-divine life which is the cause of all things whatsoever that live, and of
life itself in its essence, that life, namely which formally inheres in living things; nor, to say in
conclusion, do we call causes the principles of existing things and the creative substances and
persons, whom they have called both the gods of existing things and the self-acting
creators.

</p>
<p>To exclude this position, moreover, &#8220;under the essential goodness&#8221;, which the Platonists said
was the highest god, Dionysius pointedly says &#8220;Spiritual substances have being, and life, and
intelligence and all other such attributes pertaining to their perfection&#8221;. He likewise repeats
the same point in the individual chapters showing that they owe to the divine being that they
are, and to the divine life that they are living and so forth.</p>
<p>94. -Furthermore, it is contrary to Christian teaching that spiritual substances should be said
to derive their origin from the highest deity in such a way that they should have been from
eternity-as the Platonists and the Peripatetics, held.&#8217; But, on the contrary, the declaration of
the Catholic faith has it that they began to be after they had previously not existed.
Accordingly, it is said in Isaiah 40:26: &#8220;Lift up your eyes on high and see who created these
things,&#8221; &#8212; namely, all the higher beings. And lest it be understood about the bodies alone, he
adds, &#8220;Who brings out their host by number.&#8221; Now Sacred Scripture is in the habit of calling
the heavenly host of spiritual substances, &#8220;the heavenly army&#8221; because of their order and
power in carrying out the divine will. Therefore it is said in Luke 2:13: &#8220;There was with the
angel a multitude of heavenly army.&#8221; It is therefore given to be understood that not only
bodies but also spiritual substances were brought into being from non-being by creation.
Accordingly, it is said in Romans 4:17: &#8220;He calls those things that are not as those that are.&#8221;
Therefore Dionysius says in the tenth chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote257', WPFootnote257 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 &#8220;Sacred Scripture
does not exclusively apply the name &#8216;eternal&#8217; to that which is absolutely ungenerated and
truly eternal, but the incorruptible and immortal and invariable and unchanging, it calls
&#8216;eternal&#8217;, as when it says, &#8216;Lift up, O eternal gates&#8217; and the like, which seems especially to be
said concerning spiritual substances&#8221;. And afterwards he adds, &#8220;Therefore the eternal beings
cannot be thought to be absolutely coeternal with God, Who is before eternity&#8221;.</p>
<p>95.&#8212;But because in the succession of the creation of things, Sacred Scripture in Genesis I
makes no explicit mention of the production of spiritual substances &#8212; lest an occasion of
idolatry be given to an unlettered people to whom the law was proposed, if the divine work
should bring in many spiritual substances above all corporeal creatures &#8212; it cannot be
expressly ascertained from the canonical Scriptures when the angels were created. That they
indeed should not have been created after the corporeal beings, reason itself makes clear, for
it was not fitting that the more perfect should be created later. This point is also expressly
gathered from the authority of Sacred Scripture, for it is said in Job 38:7: &#8220;When the morning
stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made a joyful melody  through which are
understood the spiritual substances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Augustine argues in Book XI of On the City of God:
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote258', WPFootnote258 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 &#8220;Therefore the angels
already existed when the skies were made. The latter, however, were created on the fourth
day. Do we therefore say that the angels were created on the third day? No. For it is well
known what was made on that day: the earth was separated from the waters. Perhaps on the
second day? Indeed not, for the firmament was made then.&#8221; And afterwards he adds, &#8220;No
wonder, therefore, if the very angels pertain to these works of God, just as that light which
receives the name of day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore according to Augustine&#8217;s

 opinion, the spiritual creature, which is signified by the
name &#8220;heaven&#8221;, was created along with the corporeal beings, when it is said in the beginning
of Genesis (1:1): &#8220;In the beginning God created heaven and earth.&#8221; But the formation and
perfection of this spiritual creature is signified in the production of light, as is described many
times at length in the second book of <i>A Literal Commentary on Genesis</i>.

 certain thinkers say that the angels were
begotten before all creation, namely, of corporeal creatures &#8212; as Gregory the Theologian
says, &#8220;First, indeed, He thought out the angelic and celestial powers and His thinking was the
deed.&#8221; And Damascene himself agreed with this opinion. And Jerome, a pupil of the
aforementioned Gregory Nazianzen, follows the same opinion, for he says in commenting on
the Epistle to Titus,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote262', WPFootnote262 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 &#8220;Six thousand years of our time are not yet completed and how many
eternities, how many times, how many origins of ages are we to think first existed in which
the Angels, Thrones, and Dominations and the other orders served God without the
succession and measurement of time and did God&#8217;s bidding.&#8221;</p>
<p>But I do not consider either one of these positions to be contrary to sound teaching because it
seems too presumptuous to assert that such great doctors of the Church had strayed from the
sound teaching of faith. Nevertheless, Augustine&#8217;s opinion seems to agree more with his
position according to which he posits that in the production of things, there was no order of
time according to the six days which Scripture recounts; but on the contrary, he refers those
six days to the understanding of the angels brought face to face with the six kinds of things.
The opinion of Gregory Nazianzen, of Jerome, and of Damascene, however, is more fitting
according to the position of those who posit in the production of things, a succession of time
according to the aforesaid six days. For if all the creatures were not made at the same time, it
is quite probable that spiritual creatures preceded all bodies.</p>
<p>97.&#8212;If, however, it should be asked where the angels were created, it is clear that such a
question has no place if they were created before all corporeal creatures, since place is
something corporeal, unless perhaps, we should take for place, a spiritual clarity by which the
angels are illumined by God. Accordingly, Basil says in II <i>Hexaemeron</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote263', WPFootnote263 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 &#8220;We believe that if
anything did exist before the establishment of this sensible and corruptible world, it was
effected in light. For neither the dignity of the angels nor the armies of all the heavenly
beings, whether named or unnamed, whether some rational power or ministration of the spirit,
could have endured in darkness but it was fittingly clothed in light and joy. No one, I think,
will contradict this point.&#8221; If, however, the angels had been created at the same time as the
corporeal creature, the question can have a place only in that way in which it befits the angels
to be in a place &#8212; about which we shall speak below.

<p>And according to this position, certain individuals said that the angels were created in a
certain highest, brilliant heaven which they call the empyrean heavens, that is, the fiery
heavens-not from the heat but from the brilliance. And it is of this heaven that Strabo and
Bede interpret the words, &#8220;In the beginning God created heaven and earth,&#8221; though this
interpretation is not touched upon by Augustine and the other more ancient doctors of the
Church.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">WHAT MUST BE HELD CONCERNING THE CONDITION  OF THE ANGELS&#8217;
NATURE</span>
<P>98.&#8212;Next, we must consider what must be held concerning the condition of spiritual
substances according to the opinion of Catholic teaching.</p>
<p>There were certain thinkers who thought that the angels were corporeal or composed of
matter and form. Origen seems to have held this opinion in the <i>Peri Archon</i>
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote265', WPFootnote265 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 where he says,
&#8220;It is proper to the nature of God alone, that is, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit, that it be understood to exist without material substance and without any association of
a corporeal adjunct.&#8221; The words of Sacred Scripture, which seems to attribute certain
corporeal characteristics to angels and which pronounces the angels as being with corporeal
things in a corporeal place, could have moved these thinkers to posit the angels as being
corporeal: &#8212; According to the words of Matthew 18:10: &#8220;Their angels in heaven always see
the face of my Father Who is in heaven.&#8221; And Scripture asserts them to be moved, according
to the words of Isaiah (6:6,2), &#8220;And one of the seraphim flew to me.&#8221; And what is more, that
it should describe them as having a corporeal form, just as is said in the same place of the
seraphim, &#8220;The one bad six wings and the other had six wings&#8221;. And it is said about Gabriel
in Daniel 10:5-6: &#8220;Behold a man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with the finest
gold... And his body was like the chrysolite,&#8221; &#8212; and other points which are pertinent to these
are described in the same place.</p>
<p>99.&#8212;Furthermore, we have already stated above,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote266', WPFootnote266 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 on the basis of arguments they may wish
to hold, that there is in the angels a composition of form and matter, even though they are not
corporeal. But that the angels are incorporeal, is proved from the authority of Sacred
Scripture, which calls them &#8220;spirits&#8221;. For it is said in the Psalm (103:4): &#8220;You make your
angels spirit.&#8221; And the Apostle in speaking of the angels, says to the Hebrews (1:14): &#8220;All are
ministering spirits, but to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of salvation.&#8221;
Scripture, however, was accustomed to designate something corporeal by the name of &#8220;spirit&#8221;
according to the words of John 4:24: &#8220;God is a spirit and they who adore Him, must adore
Him in spirit and in truth&#8221;; and according to the words of Isaiah 31:3: &#8220;Egypt is man and not
God: and their horses, flesh and not spirit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore it is unfitting according to the view of Sacred Scripture, that angels should be
corporeal. If, however, one should wish to examine diligently the words of Sacred Scripture,
he will be able to gather from them that the angels are immaterial, for Sacred Scripture calls
them certain powers. For it is said in the Psalm (102:20,21): &#8220;Bless the Lord, all ye His
angels&#8221;, and later it is added, &#8220;Bless the Lord all His powers.&#8221; And it is said in Luke 21:26:
&#8220;For the powers of the heavens shall be moved,&#8221; which all the doctors apply to the holy
angels. Furthermore, that which is material is not a power but it has power, just as it is not an
essence but it has essence, for power follows upon essence. For neither is man his humanity
nor is he his power; and the same is the case with every other composite of matter and form.
It remains, therefore, that according to the intention of the Scriptures, angels are immaterial.</p>
<p>100.&#8212;Furthermore, both of these points are expressly ascribed to the words of Dionysius who,
speaking of the angels, says in the fourth chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>

 that &#8220;the
intellectual substances exist free from all corruption and death and matter and generation and

 that the divine government made certain material figures to stand for
the various immaterial hierarchies of angels. And in the second chapter of the same book

 he
asks why the Sacred Doctors, coming to the corporeal representation of incorporeal beings,
i.e., the angels, did not picture them with the most resplendent figures but gave earthly figures
to immaterial and Godlike simple beings.</p>
<p>It is clear from all these words that Dionysius&#8217; opinion was that the angels are immaterial and
simple substances. This is likewise clear from the fact that he frequently calls them celestial
intellects or divine minds. The intellect or the mind, however, is something incorporeal and
immaterial, as the Philosopher proves in Book III of <i>On the Soul</i>.

 that on the first day when the

likewise says that the angel is &#8220;an intellectual and incorporeal substance.&#8221; But what he later
adds creates a doubt, &#8220;It is called an incorporeal and immaterial nature with reference to us,
for everything compared to God is found to be coarse and material.&#8221; This point is introduced
so that the angel, because of his incorporeity and immateriality would not be considered to be
equal to the simplicity of the divine substance.</p>
<p>101.&#8212;The corporeal shapes or forms, however, which are sometimes attributed to the angels in
Sacred Scripture must be understood in the manner of a likeness because, as Dionysius says
in the first chapter of the <i>Celestial Hierarchy</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote273', WPFootnote273 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 &#8220;It is not possible for our mind to be raised
up to the immaterial imitation and contemplation of the celestial hierarchies, unless in accord
with its nature, it makes use of some material guidance&#8221;; &#8212; just as many corporeal things are
said about God in the Scriptures through a certain likeness. Accordingly, Dionysius expounds
in the fifteenth chapter of the <i>Celestial Hierarchy</i>
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote274', WPFootnote274 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 what spiritual thing might be signified in
the angels through all such corporeal figures. He asserts that not only corporeal forms of such
a kind are predicated of the angels by likeness, but also, these things which pertain to the
affection of the sensitive appetite, so that thereby, we might be given to understand not only
that angels are not bodies, but likewise, that they are not spirits united to bodies that they
perfect with sense life so that, thus, there maybe found in them operations of the sensitive
soul.</p>
<p>For he says in the second chapter of the <i>Celestial Hierarchy</i>
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote275', WPFootnote275 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
 &#8220;Rage is begotten in irrational
beings from a passible movement, but in angels, the irascible must be understood in a
different way, namely as showing &#8212; as I believe &#8212; their strength and reason.&#8221; Another
translation has it thus, &#8220;But in angels, rage shows their strength of reason.&#8221; And in like
manner, he says that concupiscence in the angels signifies a divine love. Agreeing with this,
Augustine says in the ninth book of the <i>City of God</i>
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote276', WPFootnote276 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

</script>
: &#8220;The holy angels punish without anger
those whom they receive for punishment by the eternal law of God; they help the suffering
without the compassion of pity; and when those whom they love fall in danger, they minister
without fear; and yet, the names of these passions are applied to them from a habit of human
speech because of a kind of likeness in works and not because of a weakness in affections.&#8221;</p>
<p>102.&#8212;Furthermore, that angels are said to be in the heavens or in some other corporeal place
must not be understood that they might be in them in a corporeal manner, namely, through a
contact of measurable quantity but in a spiritual manner through a certain contact of power.
Now the proper place of the angels is spiritual according to what Dionysius says in the fifth
chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>,

 &#8220;The highest spiritual substances are stationed on the

 &#8220;The existing intelligibles are
in intelligible places for either they are in themselves or in superior intelligibles. Since,
therefore, something intellectual is said to be locally in a body, it is said to be in a body not as
in a place but in disposition and in the sense of being present, as we say that God is in us&#8221;.
And after a few words he adds, &#8220;Since, therefore, there was something understandable in the
disposition either of place or of some thing as existing in a place, we say by improper use,
taking the place for the condition, that that is there because of the act of that which is there;
since, &#8216;indeed, we should have said, &#8216;It acts there,&#8217; we say &#8216;It is there&#8217;.&#8221; And following this,

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 says that &#8220;where the angel acts, there he is.&#8221; Augustine likewise says in Book
VIII of the <i>Literal Commentary on Genesis</i>
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote281', WPFootnote281 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
 that &#8220;the Creator spirit moves the created spirit
through time and without place; He moves the body, however, through time and place.&#8221;</p>
<p>103.&#8212;From all these arguments, we may understand that angels are in a place not in a
corporeal but in a kind of spiritual manner. And because it befits a thing to be moved and to
be in place in the same way, as a consequence, neither are angels moved in place in a
corporeal manner; but rather, their movement, which is described in the Scriptures &#8212; if it is
referred to a corporeal place &#8212; must be understood as a succession of contacts of power at
diverse places; or it must be understood according to a mystical meaning, just as in the fourth
chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote282', WPFootnote282 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Dionysius says: &#8220;The divine minds are said to be moved
in a circular manner when they are united to the illuminations of the beautiful and the good;
they are moved in a straight line, however, when they proceed to the providence of what is
subject to them; then, they are moved obliquely, however, when in their providence over
lesser beings, they remain fixed before God.&#8221;

</p>
<p>Therefore it is clear from these statements what the Sacred Doctors taught concerning the
condition of the spiritual substances, that is, of the angels, when they asserted that the angels
are incorporeal and immaterial.</p>
<br>
<A NAME="19"><p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">CHAPTER XIX</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: bold">ON THE DISTINCTION OF SPIRITUAL SUBSTANCES ACCORDING TO SACRED
TEACHING</span>
<P>104.&#8212; Furthermore, we consequently consider next what we must hold according to Sacred
Teaching concerning the distinction of spirits. Our first consideration is the difference
between good and evil. For it has been accepted among many thinkers that certain spirits are
good and certain others, evil. This is likewise proved by the authority of Sacred Scripture. For
it is said about the good spirits in Hebrews 1:14: &#8220;They are all ministering spirits, sent to
minister for them who receive the inheritance of salvation.&#8221; About the evil spirits, however, it
is said in Matthew 12:43,45: &#8220;And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks
through dry places, seeking rest and finds none.&#8221; And afterwards it is added, &#8220;Then he goes
and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself.&#8221; And although, as
Augustine narrates in the ninth book of <i>On the City of God</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote284', WPFootnote284 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote284\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 certain thinkers posited both
good and evil spirits to be gods, and likewise good and evil spirits to be called demons,
nevertheless, others more correctly assert only the good spirits to be gods. These we call
&#8220;angels&#8221;, whereas according to the received manner of speaking, &#8220;demons&#8221; are accepted only
as evil. This distinction, as he says, is reasonable.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote285', WPFootnote285 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 For the demons are named from the word
&#8220;science&#8221; in Greek, which, without charity, according to the opinion of the Apostle,5 puffs up
through pride.</p>
<p>105.&#8212;But the cause of the wickedness of the demons is not assigned by all thinkers in the
same way. For some of them assert that demons are naturally evil, as having been produced
by an evil principle and thus their nature must be evil &#8212; which is part and parcel of the error
of the Manicheans, as is clear from what has been said.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote286', WPFootnote286 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 But Dionysius refutes this error
most effectively in the fourth chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 when he says, &#8220;But neither
are the demons evil by nature.&#8221; He proves this first, because if they were naturally evil, it
would be necessary to say at one and the same time that neither had they been produced by a
good principle nor should they be numbered among existing beings, since evil is not
something existing, nor if there existed an evil nature, was it caused by a good principle.</p>
<p>In the second place, because if they are evil by nature, they are evil to themselves or to others:
if to themselves, they would destroy themselves (which is impossible), since evil has the nature of something corruptive; but if they axe evil to others, then they would have to destroy
those things to which they are evil. However, what is such by nature, must be completely such
with respect to all. It would follow therefore that they would destroy all things and this
completely. This is impossible, both because certain beings are incorruptible and cannot be
destroyed and also because those which are destroyed, are not destroyed completely.
Therefore the nature itself of the demons is not evil.</p>
<p>In the third place, if they were naturally evil, they would not have been made by God because
good produces good effects and makes them subsist. This is impossible according to that
which has been proved above
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote288', WPFootnote288 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 namely, that God must be the source of all things.</p>
<p>In the fourth place, because if the demons are always disposed in the same way, they are not
evil, for that which is always the same, belongs to the good. If, however, they are not always
evil, they are not evil by nature.</p>
<p>In the fifth place, they are not completely devoid of good, for according as they are and live
and have understanding, they desire some good.</p>
<p>106.&#8212; Now there were others who held that the demons were naturally evil, not because their
nature is evil, but because they have a certain natural inclination to evil, as Augustine advances in the tenth book of <i>On the City of God</i>

 through Porphyry, who says in the <i>Epistle to
Anebontes</i>: &#8220;Some men thought that there is a certain class of spirits which it is proper to
obey and which is deceitful by nature in all forms and in many ways, imitating the gods and
demons and the very souls of the dead.&#8221; This opinion cannot have any truth if it be posited
that demons are incorporeal and certain separate intellects. For, since every nature is good, it
is impossible that some nature should have an inclination to evil, except under the character
of some particular good. For nothing prevents some thing which is good in a particular
manner, to be called &#8220;bad&#8221; with respect to a certain nature, insofar as it is opposed to the
perfection of a higher nature; just as to be raging is a certain good with respect to a dog -
nevertheless, it is an evil with respect to man who has reason. Yet it is possible that there
should be in man, according to his sensible and corporeal nature which he shares with brutes,
a certain inclination to raging which is evil for man. But this cannot be said of an intellectual
nature because the intellect has an order to the good in general. Accordingly, it is impossible
for a natural inclination to evil to be found in demons, if they are

 that the demons are certain corporeal animals which have an intellect. And
inasmuch as they have a corporeal and sensible nature, they are subject to various passions of
the soul, just as men are subject to passions, which incline them towards evil. Accordingly,
when Apuleius was defining the demons in the book, <i>On the God of Socrates</i>

And just as he himself says: &#8220;The mind of the demons is subject to the passions of lusts,
fears, and angers and all other such things. Therefore the demons are likewise locally
separated from the gods &#8212; whom we call angels &#8212; attributing the airy places to the demons
but the ethereal ones to the angels or gods.&#8221;</p>
<p>Certain of the Doctors of the Church follow this position in some respect. For in the third
book of the <i>Literal Commentary On Genesis</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote293', WPFootnote293 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 Augustine seems to say or to leave unsettled
that the demons are airy animals because they have the nature of airy bodies; and, for that
reason, they are not destroyed by death, because there prevails in them an element, namely
air, which is quite suitable both for acting as well as being acted upon &#8212; and he says the
same thing in several other places. And Dionysius seems to posit in demons those attributes
which belong to a sensible soul; for he says in the fourth chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote294', WPFootnote294 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

that there is in demons an evil &#8212; &#8220;an irrational rage, a mad concupiscence, and wanton
fancy.&#8221; And it is clear that fancy and concupiscence and anger or rage pertain not to the
intellect but to a part of the sensitive soul. And with respect to place, certain doctors agreed
with these thinkers because they did not consider the demons to be either celestial or super-celestial angels, as Augustine relates in the third book of the <i>Literal Commentary on
Genesis</i>.

 that the demons were among the
angelic powers which were in command of the earthly order. And the Apostle in Ephesians
(2:2) calls the devil a &#8220;prince of the power of this air.&#8221;</p>
<p>108.&#8212;But something presents itself here which is worthy of consideration. For, since matter
is attributed to each species according to the suitability of its form, it does not seem possible
that there should be in a whole of a given species a natural inclination to that which is evil for
that species according to the nature of its proper form; just as there is not present in all men, a
natural inclination to the immoderation of concupiscence or anger. Therefore, it is not
possible that all demons should have a natural inclination to deception and to other evils,
even if they were all of one species. Much less &#8216; therefore, if there should be individuals in
individual species; although if they are corporeal, nothing seems to prevent many of them
from being contained under one species; for a diversity of individuals of one species could be
caused according to a diversity of matter. Therefore we shall have to say that the demons
were not always evil but some of them began to be evil, when by their own choice, they
followed the inclination of the passions. And accordingly, Dionysius says in the fourth
chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>

 that &#8220;aversion&#8221;, namely from God, &#8220;is an evil for the
demons themselves, and it is a forsaking of those things which are fitting to them because
they were carried away by pride beyond themselves.&#8221; And later on, he adds certain remarks
pertaining to punishment as &#8220;not reaching the ultimate end&#8221; and imperfection through a lack
of a due perfection, and &#8220;impotence&#8221; of pursuing that which they desire by nature and an
&#8220;infirmity&#8221; of the power conserving in them, a natural order, calling them back from evil.</p>
<p>109.&#8212;Augustine likewise says in the third book of the <i>Literal Commentary On Genesis</i>

that the transgressing angels were before their transgression, along with their leader, now a
devil and formerly an archangel, in the higher part of the air near the heaven. He gives us
clearly to understand that through their transgression, some of the angels were made evil. And

 Accordingly, Plotinus, proceeding further, says that the souls of

uncertain whether they are of good or evil merit, as Augustine sets forth in IX of <i>On the City

 of the saints in this that
the latter assert some demons to be good and others evil because of good or evil merits,
although it is not customary for us to call the good spirits &#8220;demons&#8221; but rather &#8220;angels.&#8221;</p>
<p>As to what he says, namely that the souls of the dead become demons, his position is in error.
Accordingly, Chrysostom,

 expounding on what is contained in Matthew 8:28 that two men
possessed with devils came out of the sepulchres says, &#8220;Through this fact, namely that they
were going out of the sepulchres, they wanted to impose a pernicious doctrine, that the souls
of the dying become demons. Accordingly, many soothsayers killed children so that they
might have their cooperating soul. And because of this, many demoniacs shout that &#8216;I am that
one&#8217;s soul.&#8217; However, it is not the dead person&#8217;s soul which shouts, but the demon pretends
so that he might deceive the hearers. For if it were possible for the soul of one dead to enter
the body of another, it would be much more possible for it to enter its own body. Nor is it
reasonable for a soul suffering iniquities to cooperate with the one that brings iniquities on it.
Nor likewise is it reasonable that a soul separated from the body should still be wandering
here. &#8216;The souls of the just are in the hand of God&#8217; (Wis 3:1). But those which are of sinners
are led away from here at once, as is evident from Lazarus and Dives.&#8221; Nevertheless, we must
not think that in this respect, Plotinus deviated from the opinion of the Platonists who posited
the demons to be airy bodies &#8212; namely, because Plotinus thought that the souls of men
become demons after death &#8212; for according to the Platonists&#8217; opinion, even the souls of men
have, over and above these corruptible bodies, certain ethereal bodies to which they are
always joined as to something incorruptible, even after the dissolution of these sensible
bodies. Accordingly, Proclus says in the Book of the <i>Divine Elementations</i>

 that &#8220;every soul
capable of participating, uses the first and perpetual body and one having an ungenerated and
incorruptible hypostasis.&#8221; And thus, according to them, the souls separated from the bodies,
do not cease to be airy animals.</p>
<p>111.&#8212; But according to the opinion of other Saints, the demons, whom we call evil angels,
not only came from a lower order of angels but also from the higher orders, whom we have
shown to be incorporeal and immaterial,

 so that among them, there was one who was the
highest of all. Accordingly, Gregory

 explaining in a certain homily the words of Ezechiel
28:13 &#8220;Every precious stone has covering,&#8221; says that the leader of the evil angels was, in
comparison with the other angels, more brilliant than the rest. And in this respect, he seems to
agree with those who asserted some demons to be good and others to be evil, according to
which demons are called angels. And therefore it is said in Job 4:18: &#8220;Behold they who serve
him are not steadfast, and in his angels he found wickedness.&#8221; But this presents many
difficulties. For in an incorporeal and intellectual substance, there seems to be no appetite
except the intellectual, which is of that which is absolutely good, as appears through the
Philosopher in XII <i>Metaphysics</i>.
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote310', WPFootnote310 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>
<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote310\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 Now no one is made evil from the fact that his intellect
tends toward that which is good absolutely, but from the fact that it tends toward a qualifiedly
good thing, as though it were absolutely good. Therefore it does not seem possible that an
incorporeal and intellectual substance should be made evil by its own appetite.</p>
<p>112.&#8212;Again, appetite can be only of the good or of the seeming good, for the good is that
which all beings seek and one is not rendered evil because he seeks the true good. Therefore,
every individual who is made evil through his own appetite, must seek a seeming good as
though it were truly good. This, however, cannot be unless he is deceived in his judgment,
which does not seem capable of happening in an incorporeal and intellectual substance which,
as it seems, cannot have a false apprehension. For even in our case, insofar as we understand
something, there can be no falsity. Accordingly, Augustine says in the <i>Book of Eighty-Three
Questions</i>
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote311', WPFootnote311 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 &#8220;Everyone who is deceived, that, indeed, in which he is deceived, he does not
understand.&#8221; And accordingly, concerning those things which we grasp properly by our
intellect as well as concerning the first principles, no one can be deceived. Therefore it seems
impossible that some incorporeal and intellectual substance should become evil through its
own appetite.</p>
<p>113.&#8212; Furthermore, a substance which is of an intellectual nature and separate from a body
must be absolutely free of time. For the nature of a thing is grasped from its operation while
the character of an operation is known from its object. The intelligible, however, as such, is
neither here nor now; but it is rather something abstracted both from the dimensions of place
as well as from the succession of time. Therefore, the intellectual operation itself, if it be
considered by itself, must likewise rise above all temporal succession just as it is abstracted
from all corporeal dimension. And if a magnitude or time be joined to any intellectual operation, this happens only accidentally, just as it happens in our case, in so far as our intellect
abstracts intelligible species from phantasms which it likewise considers in them-which can
have no place in an incorporeal and intellectual substance. It remains therefore that the
operation of such a substance and consequently the substance itself should be altogether
outside all temporal succession. And accordingly, Proclus
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote312', WPFootnote312 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

 says, &#8220;Every intellect has in
eternity, substance, and power, and operation.&#8221; And in the Book <i>On Causes</i>
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote313', WPFootnote313 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 it is said that
understanding &#8220;is on a par with eternity.&#8221; Therefore, whatever befits those incorporeal and
intellectual substances, befits them always and without succession. Therefore either they were
always evil &#8212; which is against what has been set down &#8212; or they could in no way have been
made evil.</p>
<p>114.&#8212; Moreover, since God is the very essence of goodness, as Dionysius says in the first
chapter of <i>On the Divine Names</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote314', WPFootnote314 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

    document.write( '<br><a href="javascript:WPHide(\'WPFootnote314\')">Close</a>' );
    document.write( '</span>' );
  }
</script>
 it is necessary that the closer they are to God, the more
firmly are certain beings strengthened in the participation of goodness. But it is evident that
intellectual, incorporeal substances are above all bodies. If, therefore, the highest bodies,
namely, the heavenly bodies are not receptive of any disorder or evil, much less could those
super-celestial substances be capable of disorder and evil. Accordingly, Dionysius says in the
fourth chapter of the <i>Celestial Hierarchy</i>,
<a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote315', WPFootnote315 )"><img src="substsepar/footnoteicon.gif" alt="Footnote" width="16" height="14" border="0"></a>

  }
</script>
 &#8220;The holy ornaments of the celestial substances
participated in the divine teaching in greater measure than those beings that only exist, those
that live with an irrational life and those that we call rational; and they have more abundant
communications with God, with their minds fixed and, as is befitting, stretched towards what
is above them in the power of a love that is divine and unswerving.&#8221; The order of things then
seems to have this, that just as the lower bodies can be subject to disorder and evil but not the
heavenly bodies, so likewise, the intellects joined to the lower bodies can be subject to evil,
but not those super-celestial substances. And this view those thinkers seemed to follow who
posited that the demons, who for us are the bad angels, are from a lower order and corporeal.</p>
