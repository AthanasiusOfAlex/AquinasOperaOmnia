      sin of man. Therefore if man consents through choice itself, he is able to 
      alter his choice again, and to depart from (what had been previously

      Spirit is unforgivable, the capacity for forgiveness is negated either on 
      the part of the one forgiving, or on the part of him to whom forgiveness 
      is given. It cannot be in the first way for the power of God Himself, who 
      alone forgives sins, is infinite, extending itself to the forgiveness of 
      all sins. Similarly, it cannot be in the second way, because the capacity 
      for forgiveness on the part of the one to whom forgiveness is given is the 
      free choice of the will existing in this earthly condition, which remains 
      even after the sin against the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the sin against the 
      Holy Spirit is in no way unforgivable</FONT></TD></TR>

      ;>respondeo dicendum, quod de peccato in spiritum sanctum duplex est 
      opinio, ut ex littera colligi potest. quidam enim accipientes 
      impoenitentiam prout est circumstantia peccati, ut dictum est, assignant 
      quinque species peccati in spiritum sanctum, quae scilicet supra 
      impoenitentiae connumeratae sunt; et dicunt, quod nulla illarum specierum 
      habet complete rationem peccati in spiritum sanctum nisi secundum quod 
      adjungitur ei haec circumstantia, ut scilicet usque ad mortem in 
      desperatione vel obstinatione perdurent; et secundum hoc dicitur peccatum 
      in spiritum sanctum irremissibile, quia nunquam remittitur vel remitti 
      potest: quia post mortem homo confirmatur in gratia vel in peccato, 
      secundum quod fuit in statu mortis suae, ut dicitur ecclesiastici 11, 3: 
      lignum in quocumque loco ceciderit, ibi erit. sed istud non videtur esse 
      conveniens: quia secundum hoc omne peccatum quod usque ad mortem perdurat, 
      irremissibile est, sive sit in patrem, sive in filium; et ita peccatum in 
      spiritum sanctum non esset alio modo irremissibile quam peccatum in patrem 
      vel filium, quod est contra textum evangelii. nisi forte diceretur, quod 
      omne peccatum in patrem vel in filium, est peccatum veniale; quia 
      gregorius dicit in 4 dialog. peccata venialia etiam post hanc vitam 
      remitti. sed hoc est expresse falsum: quia ignorantia non sic semper 
      excusat peccatum ut non sit damnabile, sed ut sit minus damnabile. et ideo 
      alii dicunt, quod impoenitentia, quae dicit continuam durationem peccati 
      usque ad mortem, non est necessaria ad hoc quod sit peccatum in spiritum 
      sanctum, quia etiam uno solo motu voluntatis potest homo in spiritum 
      sanctum peccare, sicut et in ceteris peccatis contingit;</FONT></TD>
    <TD align=left><FONT 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT 
      ;><I>Response:</I> There are two opinions concerning the sin against the 
      Holy Spirit, as can be gathered from the (Lombard's) text. Some, taking 
      impenitence as a circumstance of sin (as was said previously), designate 
      five species of the sin against the Holy Spirit which were numbered 
      previously of impenitence. They say that not any of those species have the 
      complete aspect of the sin against the Holy Spirit except in so far as 
      this circumstance is added to it, namely that they endure in despair and 
      obstinacy right up until death. In this, the sin against the Holy Spirit 
      is said to be unforgivable because in no way is it forgiven or can be 
      forgiven, since after death man is established in grace or in sin, 
      according to what he was in the moment of his death, as Ecclesiastes 11:3 
      states "In what place soever a tree shall fall, there shall it be." But 
      this position does not appear to be fitting. For every sin, either against 
      the Father or the Son, which endures right up until death is unforgivable. 
      Thus the sin against the Holy Spirit would not be unforgivable in a way 
      different from (the sins against) the Father and the Son, a position which 
      is contrary to the text of the Evangelist. Unless, perhaps, it be said 
      that every sin against the Father or the Son is a venial sin. For Gregory 
      says in his <I>4th. Dialogue</I> that even venial sins are forgiven after 
      this life. However, this is expressly false since ignorance does not thus 
      always excuse from sin so that it is not damnable, but rather so that it 
      might be less damnable. For this reason, others state that impenitence, 
      which designates the continuous duration in sin right up until death, need 
      not be (a necessary condition for a sin being) a sin against the Holy 
      Spirit. For even in one sole movement of the will, a man can sin against 
      the Holy Spirit, as occurs with certain sins.</FONT></TD></TR>

      secundum hos assignantur species peccati in spiritum sanctum sex, sicut 
      dictum est; secundum hos autem oportet dicere, quod peccatum in spiritum 
      sanctum non dicitur irremissibile quia nunquam remittatur, sed quia non 
      habet de se aptitudinem ad hoc quod remissibile sit; et hoc praecipue

      ;>According to these considerations, such people assign six species of the 
      sin against the Holy Spirit, as was said previously. With respect to 
      these, however, one should say that the sin against the Holy Spirit is not 
      designated unforgivable because it is at no time forgiven, but rather 
      because it does not have a suitability in itself for it to be forgivable. 
      This especially has three causes.</FONT></TD></TR>
  <TR vAlign=top>
    <TD align=left><FONT 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT ;>una 
      est ex causa movente ad peccandum: quandoque enim infirmitas, vel 
      ignorantia ejus qui peccat, peccatum causant, quae nata sunt peccatum 
      excusare in parte vel in toto, propter hoc quod involuntarium causant, vel 
      simpliciter vel secundum quid: et tunc peccatum remissibile dicitur quod 
      habet in se unde facile remittatur propter hoc quod ex causa excusante 
      procedit. peccatum autem quod ex industria fit, nullam rationem 
      excusationis habet; et ideo dicitur irremissibile, quia non habet in se 
      unde excusetur, et propter hoc ad remittendum sit facile. </FONT></TD>
    <TD align=left><FONT 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT ;>The 
      first is by reason of the cause moving one to sin. Sometimes the infirmity 
      or ignorance of him who sins cause the sin. (Both infirmity and ignorance) 
      are understood to excuse sin either in part or whole, as they bring about 
      the involuntary (in one's actions), either in itself or according to 
      something else. Sin, then, is said to be forgivable which has in itself 
      that by reason of which it is easily forgiven, namely that it proceed from 
      a cause which excuses the sin. However, a sin which arises by reason of 
      intention does not have the aspect of the excusable, for which reason it 
      is called unforgivable, namely because it does not have in itself that by 
      reason of which it is excused and account of which it would be easy to 
      forgive.</FONT></TD></TR>

      ;>secunda est ratio sumpta ex modo inclinationis voluntatis in peccatum: 
      quia ut philosophus dicit in 7 ethic., finis in operabilibus est sicut 
      principium indemonstrabile in speculativis. error autem in speculativis, 
      qui est circa principia indemonstrabilia, difficile removeri potest, eo 
      quod non possunt accipi aliqua magis nota, per quae error improbetur. ita 
      etiam in practicis, quando aliquis alicui peccato ut fini adhaeret, quasi 
      in eo suam beatitudinem constituens, non potest tali peccato de facili 
      remedium adhiberi: quia nihil est aliud magis a peccante dilectum, propter 
      cujus consecutionem hoc in quo ultimum finem ponit, dimittat. quicumque 
      autem ex electione peccat, vel ex industria, adhaeret peccato quod eligit, 
      quasi per se bono, et sic fini; et ideo tale peccatum non de facili 
      medicinam recipit; unde philosophusin 7 ethic. per hoc ostendit quod 
      incontinens, quia ex passione peccat, sive infirmitate, facilius curatur 
      quam intemperatus, qui peccat ex electione, sive ex industria. et hae duae 
      praedictae causae ostendunt causam irremissibilitatis non solum in peccato 
      quod proprie dicitur in spiritum sanctum, sed etiam in quolibet peccato 
      quod est ex electione.</FONT></TD>
    <TD align=left><FONT 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT ;>The 
      second cause is the reasoning undertaken because of the mode of the will's 
      inclination in sin. For, as the Philosopher says in Book VII of the 
      <I>Nichomachean Ethics</I>, the end in practical matters is like an 
      indemonstrable principle in speculative matters. An error in speculative 
      matters, which is about indemonstrable principles, can, with difficulty, 
      be removed, in that something better known cannot be grasped by which the 
      error is disproved. In this way, even in practical matters, when someone 
      adheres to a sin as to an end, as if his very beatitude were to be found 
      in it, he cannot easily apply a remedy to this sort of sin; for there is 
      nothing else desired more by the sinner, that he dismisses (such remedies) 
      for the sake of the attainment of that in which he finds (his) ultimate 
      end. Anyone who sins by reason of choice, or by intention, adheres to the 
      sin which he chooses, as if it were good itself, and thus (his) end. For 
      this reason this sort of sin does not easily admit of medicine. Whence, 
      the Philosopher shows in Book VII of his <I>Nichomachean Ethics</I> that 
      the incontinent, because he sins by reason of his passion, or infirmity, 
      is more easily cured than the intemperate, who sin by reason of choice, or 
      intention. These two causes just discussed display the cause of that for 
      which there is no forgiveness not only in sin which is properly said to be 
      against the Holy Spirit, but also in any sin which is by reason of choice.

      sumitur ex ejus objecto: quia peccatum in spiritum sanctum est ex hoc quod 
      voluntas a se repellit id per quod remissio peccatorum fit. unde sicut 
      aegritudo diceretur incurabilis quae fastidium medicinae faceret; ita et 
      peccatum irremissibile dicitur per cujus actum spiritualis medicina 
      directe repellitur: et tamen sicut ille morbus corporalis virtute divina

      third cause which properly regards the sin against the Holy Spirit is 
      taken from its object. For the sin against the Holy Spirit arises in so 
      far as the will pushes away from itself that through which the forgiveness 
      of sins comes about. Hence, just as a sickness is said to be incurable 
      which brings about a loathing of medicine, so too a sin is called 
      unforgivable through whose act spiritual medicine is directly pushed away. 
      Nevertheless, just as that sickness of the body can be miraculously cured 
      by the divine power, so too sins of this kind can be forgiven through the 
      divine mercy, miraculously, as it were.</FONT></TD></TR>

      ;><I>Response to Objection 2: </I>Hope directly is of those things to 
      which we tend as to an ultimate end. For this reason withdrawal of hope 
      destroys the end, and thus despair is an unforgivable sin, just as an 
      error of principles is incurable. Love, however, is not only of the end, 
      but it is also of those things which lead to the end, namely of proximate 
      things. Thus, if one sins against one's love of proximate things, 
      nevertheless one does not sin on account of this directly against the love 
      of God. Hence on the part of that (sin), the way to cure remains. If, 
      however, one directly sins against the love of God, as He is the direction 
      of the end, it will thus be an unforgivable sin against the Holy Spirit, 
      and this when one envies grace to which he has been reconciled. The same 
      is to be said concerning faith because infidelity can proceed either from 
      ignorance, and thus have the "dress" (so to speak) of the excusable and 
      the easily forgiven, or from definite malice, and thus be a sin against 
      the Holy Spirit, which is the resisting of the known truth.</FONT></TD></TR>

      spiritum sanctum dicitur, procedit, nominat quemdam actum peccati, ut 
      actum desperationis vel obstinationis, et hujusmodi, et non sumitur

      ;><I>Response to Objection 3: </I>Malice is not the cause of the 
      involuntary, or of infirmity and ignorance. Thus, it is not fitting that 
      it (malice) excuses or alleviates, as those do (namely infirmity and 
      ignorance). Or, it should be said that malice from which proceeds that sin 
      which is said to be against the Holy Spirit, designates a certain act of 
      sin, for example, the act of despair, obstinacy, or other such acts, and 
      is not to be understood in so far as it is a penalty, for example, as it 
      designates a defect of the rational soul, according to which it is easily 
      inclinable to evil.</FONT></TD></TR>

      ;><I>Response to Objection 4: </I>A sin can be unforgivable in two ways, 
      either by reason of the kind of sin, and thus the sin against the Holy 
      Spirit is called unforgivable, or by reason of the condition of the 
      sinner, and thus every sin in which (the condition or state of one's) life 
      (or journey) is completed is unforgivable, either of man or of the angels. 
      And according to this, a difference between man and the angels is 
      understood, for the condition of life (or of the journey) in the angels is 
      completed immediately after their first choice, not, however, is this so 
      among men.</FONT></TD></TR>
