      For when the truth has come, the figure ought to cease. But this sacrament 
      is enacted as a figure of the Lord's passion, which has already really 
      come. Therefore this sacrament ought not to have been 
  instituted.</FONT></TD></TR>

      dispositione removetur. Sed ad eamdem actionem non debet institui nisi 
      unum sacramentum, sicut unum instrumentum est unius actionis. Cum ergo per 
      Baptismum mundemur a malo, videtur quod non oportuit institui aliquod

      Further, in the same action, something is instituted and is removed from a 
      contrary disposition. But for accomplishing the same action there ought 
      only to be instituted a single sacrament, as there is a single instrument 
      for a single action. Since therefore we are cleansed from evil through 
      baptism, it seems that there ought not to have been instituted a sacrament 
      through which we are confirmed in good, namely the Eucharist, as the text 
      describes it.</FONT></TD></TR>

      The body's perfection requires that the members be joined to the head. But 
      through this sacrament, the members of the Church are joined to its head; 
      hence in John 6:57 it says: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood, 
      abides in me and I in him." Therefore this sacrament's institution was 
      necessary.</FONT></TD></TR>

      that its institution was necessary.</FONT></TD></TR>

      inveniuntur plures actiones ordinatae diversis agentibus ordinatis 
      distributae, oportet quod principalis illarum actionum attribuatur 
      principali agenti, cujus virtute secundarii agentes operantur secundarias 
      actiones; sicut patet in artibus quae sub invicem continentur, ut 
      militaris, equestris, et frenorum factrix. Et quia invenimus diversas 
      actiones sacramentales diversis sacramentis distributas, quae in virtute 
      verbi incarnati agunt, oportet ad perfectam actionem hujus generis esse 
      aliquam sacramentalem actionem quae ipsimet principali agenti attribuatur, 
      quod est verbum incarnatum; et ideo oportuit esse sacramentum 
      Eucharistiae, quod ipsum verbum incarnatum contineret, ceteris sacramentis 
      tamen in virtute ipsius agentibus; et ideo convenienter in figura cibi hoc 
      sacramentum institutum est: quia inter alios sensus solus tactus est cui 
      suum sensibile realiter conjungitur, similitudinibus tantum sensibilium ad 
      alios sensus per medium pervenientibus: gustus autem tactus quidam est: et 
      inter alia quae ad tactum pertinent, solus cibus est qui agit per 
      conjunctionem sui ad cibatum, quia nutriens et nutritum fit unum; alia

    <TD align=left><FONT 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT ;>It 
      should be said that in any genus of actions in which are found many 
      ordered actions distributed among a variety of ordered agents, the chief 
      of those actions must be attributed to the chief agent, by whose power the 
      secondary agents enact their secondary actions, as is evident in arts that 
      are contained one beneath the other, as the military, equestrian, and 
      bridlemaking arts [where in each case the latter takes orders from the 
      former]. And since we find a variety of sacramental actions distributed 
      among a variety of sacraments, which act by the power of the incarnate 
      Word, for a perfect action of this genus [to take place] there must be 
      some sacramental action that is attributed to the chief agent himself, 
      namely the incarnate Word; and thus there had to be the sacrament of the 
      Eucharist, which would contain the very Word incarnate, with the remaining 
      sacraments as agents [acting] by his power. And thus, fittingly was this 
      sacrament instituted in the likeness of food,<FONT size=2><A

      joined to its sensible, with only the likenesses of sensibles reaching the 
      other senses through a medium; but taste is a kind of touch, and among the 
      things that pertain to touch, only food acts by its being joined to the 
      one fed, since the nourishing and the nourished are made one, whereas 
      other tangible items act by bringing about some impressions in that which 
      they touch, as is evident with hot and cold, and such 
      [qualities].</FONT></FONT></FONT></TD></TR>

      being converted into it by conjunction with it, according to what 
      Augustine says, speaking in the person of the incarnate Word: "You shall 
      not change me into you, as food of your flesh, but you shall be changed

      primum ergo dicendum, quod secundum Dionysium nostra hierarchia est media 
      inter caelestem et eam quae in veteri lege erat. Tempore enim legis erat 
      veritas promissa tantum; sed in statu novae legis est veritas inchoata per 
      Jesum Christum; in patria autem erit veritas consummata. Et ideo in veteri 
      lege figurae sine rebus proponebantur; in nova autem proponuntur figurae 
      cum rebus; in patria autem res sine figuris. Et ideo orat Ecclesia ut quod

      To the first, therefore, it should be said that according to Dionysius our 
      hierarchy is in between the heavenly and that which was in the old law. 
      For in the time of the law there was the promise alone; but in the state 
      of the new law there is the dawning of truth<FONT size=2><A

      size=3> <A name=through>through</A> Jesus Christ; while in the fatherland 
      there will be consummate truth. And so, in the old law, figures were 
      proposed without the realities [to which the figures pointed]; while in 
      the new, figures are proposed along with realities; but in the fatherland, 
      [there will be] realities without figures. And so the church prays that 
      "what we now carry by hope along the way, we may take hold of in the 
      fatherland by the truth of the realities."</FONT></FONT></FONT></TD></TR>

      To the second, it should be said that this objection holds concerning that 
      perfection by which something is perfected in that it receives a form - 
      the kind of perfection achieved through baptism; but it does not hold for 
      that which occurs through union with the [very] source of perfection, a 
      union achieved through the Eucharist, as was said above.</FONT></TD></TR>

      since the food of our flesh must be transmuted into ourselves; and so it 
      must agree with us in matter. It is otherwise with <I>spiritual</I> food,

      incarnatione nondum facta; et ideo in veteri lege hujus sacramenti 
      institutio esse non potuit. Unde sacramenta veteris legis habebant se ad 
      modum sensibilium quae per medium cognoscuntur, quae quidem realiter 
      sentienti non conjunguntur, sed suas similitudines ad sensus a longinquo 
      transmittunt. Sacramenta vero alia novae legis, in quibus virtus Christi 
      operatur, cum ipsum realiter non contineant, assimilantur sensibilibus jam 
      dictis, quae quidem non incorporantur sentienti, sed secundum aliquam 
      qualitatem immutant. Hoc autem sacramentum, ut dictum est, quasi majoris 
      perfectionis, similatur illi sensibili quod incorporatur sentienti, 
      scilicet cibo; unde magis distat a modo sacramentorum veteris legis quam 
      sacramenta novae legis.</FONT></TD>

      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT ;>It 
      should be said that, as was said earlier, in this sacrament the very 
      Christ who is the principal agent of [our] sanctification, is really put 
      before us. Now, in the Old Law he was not presented but rather promised, 
      the Incarnation not yet having happened; and so in the Old Law the 
      institution of this sacrament could not be. Hence the sacraments of the 
      Old Law functioned in the manner of sensible things that are known through 
      a medium, which nevertheless are not really joined to the thing sensed, 
      but rather transmit their likenesses to the sense-power from afar. Now 
      indeed, the other [six] sacraments of the New Law, in which the power of 
      Christ is at work, since they do not really contain him, are likened to 
      the sensibles just mentioned, which are not incorporated into the one 
      sensing, but <I>do </I>bring about change according to some quality [they 
      have upon contact]. But this sacrament, as was said, as having a greater 
      perfection, is likened to that sensible object that is incorporated into 
      the one sensing, namely food. Hence it stands further from the mode of the 
      sacraments of the Old Law than the other sacraments of the New Law do, 
      [and so much less should it have been instituted prior to the coming of 
      Christ].</FONT></TD></TR>

      conformity in nature with the members of the Church, the Incarnation not 
      yet having happened, but only according to the faith of those who were 
      looking forward to the Incarnation; and therefore the union of the 
      mystical body with its head could not have been accomplished at that time

      To the second, it should be said that the people of Israel was the most

      whom it is said in 1 Peter 2:9: "You are a holy nation, a people for his

      says in the text. Therefore after the paschal supper he ought to have

      tertiam quaestionem dicendum, quod propter quatuor rationes hoc 
      sacramentum in coena institui debuit, et non ante. Prima apparet ex ipsa 
      necessitate sacramenti assignata: quia ad perfectionem nostram exigebatur 
      ut caput nostrum etiam nobis realiter conjungeretur; et ideo quamdiu sub 
      propria specie cum hominibus conversatus est, non oportebat hoc 
      sacramentum institui, sed quando ejus corporali praesentia destituenda 
      erat Ecclesia; et haec ratio tangitur in littera ab Eusebio: <I>quia</I>, 
      inquit, <I>corpus assumptum ablaturus erat</I> et cetera. Secunda sumitur 
      ex ejus figura. Christus enim quamdiu in mundo conversatus est, figuras 
      legis observare voluit, factus sub lege, ut eos qui sub lege erant 
      redimeret. Et quia veniente veritate cessat figura, ideo non debuit hoc 
      sacramentum institui nisi Christo ascendente per mortem, quando figurae 
      veteris legis terminandae erant. Tertia ratio sumitur ab ipsa 
      repraesentatione hujus sacramenti. Est enim repraesentativum dominicae 
      passionis; et ideo congrue jam passione imminente instituitur. Quarta 
      ratio sumitur ex ritu quo frequentandum est hoc sacramentum, ut ultimo 
      traditum magis memoriae teneretur.</FONT></TD>
    <TD align=left><FONT 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT ;>It 
      should be said that this sacrament ought to have been instituted at the 
      Last Supper and not before, on account of four reasons. The first is 
      apparent from the very necessity of the sacrament that was earlier 
      assigned, for it was required for our perfection that our head be joined 
      to us even in a real manner [and not just by a profession of faith]; and 
      so as long as he conversed with men in the proper appearance of a man, he 
      did not need to institute this sacrament, but when the Church was being 
      deprived of his bodily presence; and this reason is touched on in the text 
      by Eusebius: "For," he says, "the body assumed was about to be taken 
      away," etc. The second is taken from its figure. For Christ as long as he 
      was living in the world wanted to observe the figures of the law: "made 
      under the law, that he might redeem those who were under the law" (cf. 
      Gal. 4:4-5). And since the figure ceases when the truth is come, therefore 
      this sacrament ought not to have been instituted except by Christ mounting 
      up through death, when the figures of the Old Law were being brought to 
      their end. The third reason is taken from the very representation of this 
      sacrament. For it is representative of the Passion of the Lord; and so it 
      was congruously instituted right when the Passion was at hand. The fourth 
      reason is taken from the rite by which this sacrament is to be frequented, 
      so that the last thing handed down might be held in greater 
      remembrance.</FONT></TD></TR>

      immemores pressurae passionis propter gaudium resurrectionis; et ideo

      To the first, therefore, it should be said that the hearts of the 
      disciples were more affected regarding the Passion when the Passion was 
      about to occur than by the Passion already accomplished, when they were 
      already forgetful of the oppression of the Passion on account of the joy 
      of the Resurrection; and so the memorial of the Passion was better put 
      before them before than after. Nor was it at that time a memorial but it 
      was instituted so that later on it might be celebrated in memory [of the 
      Passion].</FONT></TD></TR>

      idem ordo institutionis sacramentorum et perceptionis: quia ad finem qui 
      nobis praestituitur, ultimo pervenimus. Sed Eucharistia est quodammodo

      To the second, it should be said that baptism, even before the Passion, 
      was instituted in a certain respect, as was said above; and further, it is 
      not necessary that there be the same order in the institution of the 
      sacraments as there is in their reception, since the end that is 
      determined in advance for us is what we arrive at last of all. But the 
      Eucharist is, in a certain sense, the end of baptism, since through 
      baptism someone is consecrated for the reception of the Eucharist, as by 
      Holy Orders one is consecrated for the consecration of the Eucharist. And 
      so the argument given does not follow.</FONT></TD></TR>

      To the third, it should be said that although this sacrament is, as it 
      were, the last in reception, it is nevertheless the first in intention. 
      The institution, however, corresponds to the order of intention; and 
      therefore, upon the termination of the sacraments of the Old Law, this was 
      the first to be instituted.</FONT></TD></TR>

      capere potest. Apostoli autem a principio non tanti capaces erant 
      mysterii; et ideo in fine hoc eis proponendum fuit. Et praeterea ratio 
      illa procedit de illis quae memoriae imprimuntur propter seipsa; in illis 
      autem quae memoriae imprimit affectio ad dicentem, secus est: quia tunc 
      firmius imprimuntur quando affectionis motus ad dicentem major sentitur. 
      Quanto autem aliquis ad amicum diutius conversatur, fit major dilectio; et 
      quando ab amicis separatur, sentitur motus dilectionis ferventior propter 
      dolorem separationis; et ideo verba amicorum a nobis recedentium finaliter

    <TD align=left><FONT 
      face="Arial, Helvetica, Geneva, Swiss, SunSans-Regular" size=3 FONT ;>4. 
      To the fourth [the <I>sed contra</I>], it should be said that that 
      argument works for the things that someone was able to grasp from the 
      beginning. But the Apostles from the beginning were not so capable of 
      [receiving] mysteries; and so, this [mystery of the Eucharist] was put 
      before them at the very end. And further, that argument works for things 
      that are imprinted on the memory on account of themselves; but in those 
      things that affection for the speaker imprints on the memory, it is 
      otherwise; for they are then imprinted more firmly when a greater motion 
      of affection is felt for the speaker. Now the longer someone keeps company 
      with a friend, the greater love becomes; and when he is separated from the 
      friend, the motion of love is more fervently felt on account of the pain 
      of separation; and thus the words spoken at the last by friends departing 
      from us are the more imprinted upon the memory.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
